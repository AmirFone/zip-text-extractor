Geor Ge \nW. Casey Jr. (ret.)le a di ng  \nin a\n\u2018 v uc a\u2019  \nworldGen. Casey leaves  \na meeting with  \nIraqi army officers  \nin Baghdad, \n february 2007.\nI Was re Cently asked to address the students of the unI vers Ity of \nNorth Carolina\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School on \u201cLeading in a VUCA World.\u201d \nI must admit that as soon as I got off the call with the school\u2019s executive director, \nI went to the computer and Googled \u201cVUCA.\u201d Ten seconds later it was clear why \nthe acronym was vaguely familiar to me: It was a term coined by the U.S. Army \nWar College in the early 1990s to describe what the world would be like after the \nSoviet Union\u2019s collapse: volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.\nIn reality, VUCA has never been more relevant, for the military and for busi-\nness. I experienced VUCA environments in Bosnia (1996), in Kosovo (2000), \nand in Iraq (2004\u201307). Leading grew progressively more difficult in those \nconflicts, with Iraq unquestionably the toughest. I believe that my experiences \nleading in those environments can benefit business leaders.\nThe reason is that the primary function of any leader is to point the way \nahead. I\u2019ve learned that doing so in VUCA environments is extraordinarily \ndifficult. Leaders need to \u201csee around corners\u201d\u2014to see something significant \nabout the future that others don\u2019t see. Yet the more VUCA the environment, \nthe harder it is for leaders themselves to comprehend the situation, let alone \narticulate a clear way forward. VUCA environments thus become invitations \nfor inaction\u2014people are befuddled by the turmoil and don\u2019t act. And to suc -\nceed, you must act! \nEffective action begins with a clear statement of what needs to be accom-\nplished. As the commander in Iraq and later as the Army Chief of Staff, I made \nthe No.  1 question I asked: \u201cWhat are we really trying to accomplish?\u201d The \nhigher in the organization I was, the more complex the issues became and the \nharder it was for me to answer that question clearly and succinctly. I had to \nforce myself to get clarity in my own mind so that I could clearly articulate to my \nsubordinates how I saw things and what I wanted them to do. I found that the casey: carlos barria\u2014reuters\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.The WOR L d\u2019s 50 gReATesT LeAdeRs      \nfortune.com/bestleaders\n76leaders possess only so muc H \nintellectual and emotional \nenergy. w e must expend t Hat \nenergy in t He areas t Hat  \nproduce t He HigHest payoff.George W.

Without a clear focus, there was no com-mon purpose, and without common purpose, there wasn\u2019t effective execution. In war\u2014and business\u2014that is fatal.\nConsider my experience in Iraq. When I took command \nin July 2004, I had about 30 days to come to grips with the new environment, build a relationship with the new Iraqi government, and develop a plan for succeeding, all the while keeping a burgeoning insurgency at bay. I had a lot on my plate. \nThen, almost immediately, we confronted a country-\nwide uprising after a young Marine made a wrong turn and drove too close to a militia leader\u2019s house in the key city of Najaf, home to the Imam Ali Mosque, the third-holiest site in Shia Islam. In response the militia leader, \nMuqtada al-Sadr, whose forces had been terrorizing the \npopulation of Najaf for months, rapidly mobilized his forces in Najaf, Baghdad, and southern Iraq, and fighting escalated. That\u2019s volatility.\nWith an inexperienced Iraqi government, a mere two \nbattalions in the Iraqi army, 162,000 coalition forces from 33 countries engaged in a form of combat for which they had not prepared, in a culture they didn\u2019t fully under-stand or appreciate, and against a diverse and committed enemy, our ability to achieve our desired outcome was hugely uncertain. In addition, Iraq was the most complex environment I had ever experienced. I had to consider not only what the U.S. government wanted but also how our decisions would affect the Iraqi government, our coalition of 33 countries, and the varying Iraqi factions\u2014and that was just our side. In war the enemy has a vote. On almost every issue I had to consider multiple and competing internal and external variables that, if I chose incorrectly, could produce undesirable outcomes. \nAmbiguity? The reporting that I received was all over \nthe map\u2014Sadr had been killed! No, he was just wounded. An errant bomb had damaged the mosque! No, it was the hotel next door. The Iraqi Special Forces had arrived! No, they were still on the way. \nVUCA conditions conspired to postpone action. Yet I \nhad to act fast because my troops were under attack. \nOver the years I had developed an offensive mindset\u2014\nI worked aggressively and opportunistically to gain an advantage. That attitude kept me from being cowed by the complexity and ambiguity of the situation, and I was able to perform a leader\u2019s first duty\u2014to point a clear way ahead. I quickly saw the battle for Najaf as an opportunity for the new Iraqi government to demonstrate its strength. In less than 24 hours, I consulted with the Prime Minis-ter and instructed my forces to restore Iraqi government control of Najaf, which in the following weeks they did. The Prime Minister had his first victory.\nI got the chance to apply what I had learned in Iraq \nwhen I became the Army Chief of Staff in 2007. As I be-gan developing my vision to guide the Army through my four-year tenure, I initially thought it would be something flashy, like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Army\u2014an agile, disciplined warrior team, dominant across the spectrum of 21st-century con-flict.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. \nIn a four-month tour of the Army, talking with men \nand women of all ranks, I found an organization stretched by six years of war and facing another five to 10 years of continual deployments. Over 3,000 soldiers had given their lives, leaving 10,000 surviving family members. Another 25,000 soldiers had been wounded, some 5,000 seriously enough to require long-term care. We also were just beginning to come to grips with the impacts of post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury on thousands of soldiers. In all the turbulence, readiness suffered. The magnificent volunteer force that we had built so painstak-ingly since the early 1970s was seriously frayed. \nI came to see the Army as out of balance\u2014so weighed \ndown by current demands that we couldn\u2019t adequately care for soldiers or prepare for the future. I realized that when you are out of balance, there is only one thing to do: Get back in balance. I thus arrived at a simple\u2014and clear\u2014vision statement: \u201cPut the Army Back in Balance.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite so glamorous a vision as I had originally imagined, but because it was clear, it guided a Herculean Army-wide effort that left us in a fundamentally different and better position four years later. \nLeaders are human and possess only so much intellec-\ntual and emotional energy. To succeed in a VUCA world, we must expend that energy in the areas that produce the highest payoff for our organizations. Our first priority must be developing and articulating a clear vision to drive our organizations\u2019 actions. The clearer leaders can be about what they want to accomplish, the better their organiza-tions will execute in the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of today\u2019s global business environment.\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.The Main Advantages of Municipal Bonds\nInvestors are attracted to municipal bonds for three \nreasons, safety of principal, regular predictable income and the tax-free benefits. Together, these three elements can make a compelling case for including tax-free municipal bonds in your portfolio. \nPotential Safety of Principal\nMany investors, particularly those nearing retirement or in retirement, are concerned about protecting their principal. In March of 2012, Moody\u2019s published research that showed that rated investment grade municipal bonds had an average cumulative default rate of just 0.08% between 1970 and 2011.* That means while there is some risk of principal loss, investing in rated investment-grade municipal bonds can be a cornerstone for safety of your principal. \nPotential Regular Predictable Income \nMunicipal bonds typically pay interest every six months unless they get called or default. That means that you can count on a regular, predictable income stream. Because most bonds have call options, which means you get your principal back before the maturity date, subsequent municipal bonds you purchase can earn more or less interest than the called bond. According to Moody\u2019s 2012 research,* default rates are historically low for the rated investment-grade bonds favored by Hennion & Walsh.\nPotential Triple Tax-Free Income \nIncome from municipal bonds is not subject to federal income tax and, depending on where you live, may also be exempt from state and local taxes. T riple tax-free can be a big attraction for many investors in this time of looming tax increases.\nAbout Hennion & Walsh\nSince 1990 Hennion & Walsh has specialized in investment grade tax-free municipal bonds. The company supervises over $2 billion in assets in over 15,000 accounts, providing individual investors with institutional quality service and personal attention.\nWhat To Do Now\nCall 1-800-316-2804 and request our Bond Guide, written by the experts at Hennion & Walsh.

Securities offered through Hennion & Walsh Inc. Member of FINRA, SIPC. Investing in bonds involves risk including possible loss of principal. Income may be subject to state, local or federal alternative minimum tax. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, prices rise. *Source: Moody\u2019s Investor Service, March 7, 2012 \u201cU.S. Municipal Bond Defaults and Recoveries, 1970-2011.\u201d Past performance is no guarantee of future results.Dear Investor,\nWe urge you to call and get your free Bond Guide.

    "Desktop/Cornell/Leadership Skills/JimCollinsHowToManageThroughChaos.pdf": "Jim Collins: How to manage through chaos  \nSeptember 30, 2011, 9:00 AM EDT  \n \nIt\u2019s one thing to rise to greatness. It\u2019s another to do so in a time of upheaval, disruption, and economic \nturmoil (hello, 2011). How do some companies do it? Management guru Jim Collins shares the answers \nfor the first time here.  \n \nFORTUNE \u2013 Perhaps the most influential management thinker alive, \nJim Collin s addressed the reasons companies succeed and fail in \nbestselling books like Good to Great  and Built to Last . In their new \nbook, Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos and Luck \u2014 Why Some \nThrive Despite Them All , Collins and co -author Morten T. Hansen \nstudied  leadership in turbulent times, a topic they chose in 2002 that \ncould not be more relevant today. Below, an exclusive excerpt:  \nWe cannot predict the future. But we can create it.  \nThink back to 15 years ago, and consider what\u2019s happened since, the \ndestabili zing events \u2014 in the world, in your country, in the markets, in \nyour work, in your life \u2014 that defied all expectations. We can be \nastonished, confounded, shocked, stunned, delighted, or terrified, but \nrarely prescient. None of us can predict with certainty  the twists and \nturns our lives will take. Life is uncertain, the future unknown.  \nWe began the nine -year research project behind this book in 2002, when America awoke from its false sense of \nstability, safety, and wealth entitlement. The long -running bull market crashed. The government budget surplus \nflipped back to deficits. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, horrified and enraged people everywhere, and \nwar followed. Meanwhile, throughout the world, technological change and global competition continu ed their \nrelentless, disruptive march. It led us to a simple question: Why do some companies thrive in uncertainty, even \nchaos, and others do not? When buffeted by tumultuous events, when hit by big, fast -moving forces that we can \nneither predict nor contr ol, what distinguishes those who perform exceptionally well from those who \nunderperform or worse?  \nWe don\u2019t choose study questions. They choose us. Sometimes one of the questions just grabs us around the \nthroat and growls, \u201cI\u2019m not going to release my grip and let you breathe until you answer me!\u201d This study \ngrabbed us because of our own persistent angst and gnawing sense of vulnerability in a world that feels \nincreasingly disordered.  \nYet some companies and leaders navigate this type of world exceptionally w ell. They don\u2019t merely react; they \ncreate. They don\u2019t merely survive; they prevail. They don\u2019t merely succeed; they thrive. They build great \nenterprises that can endure. We do not believe that chaos, uncertainty, and instability are good; companies, \nleader s, organizations, and societies do not thrive on chaos. But they can thrive in chaos.  \nTo get at the question of how, we embarked upon an ambitious journey to identify and study a select group of \ncompanies that had done just that. We set out to find compani es that started from a position of vulnerability, \nrose to become great companies with spectacular performance, and did so in unstable environments \ncharacterized by big forces, out of their control, fast -moving, uncertain, and potentially harmful. We then \ncompared these companies to a control group of companies that failed to become great in the same extreme \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.environments, using the contrast between winners and also -rans to uncover the distinguishing factors that allow \nsome to thrive in uncertainty.  \nFrom an initial list of 20,400 companies, we sifted \nthrough 11 layers of cuts to identify cases that met all \nour tests (our study era ran through 2002). Only seven \ndid. We labeled our high -performing study cases with \nthe moniker \u201c10X\u201d because they didn\u2019t merely get by or \njust become successful. They truly thrived. Every 10X \ncase beat its industry index by at least 10 times. \nConsider one 10X case, Southwest Airlines . Just think \nof everything that slammed the airline industry from \n1972 to 2002: Fuel shocks. Deregulation. Labor strife. \nAir-traffic controller strikes. Crippling recessions. \nInterest rate spikes. Hijackings. Bankruptcy after \nbankruptcy after bankruptcy. And in 2001, the terrorist \nattacks of Sept. 11. And yet if you\u2019d invested $10,000 in \nSouthwest Airlines on Dec. 31, 1972 (when it was just a tiny little outfit with three airplanes, barely reaching \nbreakeven and besieged by larger airlines out to kill the fledgling), your $10,000 would have grown to nearly \n$12 million by the end of 2002, a return 63 times better than the general stock ma rket. These are impressive \nresults by any measure, but they\u2019re astonishing when you take into account the roiling storms, destabilizing \nshocks, and chronic uncertainty of Southwest\u2019s environment. Meanwhile, Southwest\u2019s direct comparison, \nPacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), flailed and was rendered irrelevant, despite having the same business model \nin the same industry with the same opportunity to become great.  \nWhy did the 10X companies achieve such spectacular results, especially when direct comparisons \u2014 companies \noperating in the same fast -moving, unpredictable, and tumultuous environments \u2014 did not? Part of the answer \nlies in the distinctive behaviors of their leaders.  \nAre you an Amundsen or a Scott?  \nIn October 1911, two teams of adventurers made their final preparations in their quest to be the first people in \nmodern history to reach the South Pole. For one team, it would be a race to victory and a safe return home. For \nthe second team, it would be a devastating defeat, reaching the Pole only to find the wind -whipped flags of their \nrivals planted 34 days earlier, followed by a race for their lives \u2014 a race that they lost in the end, as the \nadvancing winter swallowed them up. All five members of the sec ond Pole team perished, staggering from \nexhaustion, suffering the dead -black pain of frostbite, and then freezing to death as some wrote their final \njournal entries and notes to loved ones back home.  \nIt\u2019s a near -perfect matched pair. Here we have two exped ition leaders \u2014 Roald Amundsen, the winner, and \nRobert Falcon Scott, the loser \u2014 of similar ages (39 and 43) and with comparable experience. Amundsen and \nScott started their respective journeys for the Pole within days of each other, both facing a roundtri p of more \nthan 1,400 miles into an uncertain and unforgiving environment, where temperatures could easily reach 20\u02da \nbelow zero even during the summer, made worse by gale -force winds. And keep in mind, this was 1911. They \nhad no means of modern communicatio n to call back to base camp \u2014 no radio, no cellphones, no satellite links \n\u2014 and a rescue would have been highly improbable at the South Pole if they screwed up. One leader led his \nteam to victory and safety. The other led his team to defeat and death.  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. \nWhat separated these two men? Why did one achieve spectacular \nsuccess in such an extreme set of conditions, while the other failed even \nto survive? It\u2019s a fascinating question and a vivid analogy for our overall \ntopic. Here we have two leaders, both on quests for extreme \nachievement in an extreme environment. And it turns out that the 10X \nbusiness leaders in our research behaved very much like Amundsen and \nthe comparison leaders behaved much more like Scott.  \nAmundsen and Scott achieved dramatically different outcomes not \nbecause they faced dramatically different circumstances. In the first 34 \ndays of their respective expeditions, according to Roland Huntford in his \nsuperb book The Last Place on Earth , Amundsen and Scott had exactly \nthe same ratio, 56%, of good days to bad days of weather. If they faced \nthe same environment in the same year with the same goal, the causes of \ntheir respective success and failure simply cannot be the environment. \nThey had divergent outcomes principally because they displayed very \ndifferent behaviors.  \nSo, too, with the leaders in our research study. Like Amu ndsen and Scott, our matched pairs were vulnerable to \nthe same environments at the same time. Yet some leaders proved themselves to be 10Xers while leaders on the \nother side of the pair did not.  \nLet\u2019s first look at what we did not find about 10Xers relativ e to their less successful comparisons: They\u2019re not \nmore creative. They\u2019re not more visionary. They\u2019re not more charismatic. They\u2019re not more ambitious. They\u2019re \nnot more blessed by luck. They\u2019re not more risk -seeking. They\u2019re not more heroic. And they\u2019re n ot more prone \nto making big, bold moves. To be clear, we\u2019re not saying that 10Xers lacked creative intensity, ferocious \nambition, or the courage to bet big. They displayed all these traits, but so did their less successful comparisons.  \nSo then, how did the  10Xers distinguish themselves? First, they embrace a paradox of control and noncontrol. \nOn the one hand, 10Xers understand that they face continuous uncertainty and that they cannot control, and \ncannot accurately predict, significant aspects of the world around them. On the other hand, they reject the idea \nthat forces outside their control or chance events will determine their results; they accept full responsibility for \ntheir own fate.  \n10Xers then bring this idea to life by a triad of core behaviors: fana tic discipline, empirical creativity, and \nproductive paranoia. And they all led their teams with a surprising method of self -control in an out -of-control \nworld.  \nThe 20 -Mile March  \nImagine you\u2019re standing with your feet in the Pacific Ocean in San Diego, loo king inland. You\u2019re about to \nembark on a 3,000 -mile walk, from San Diego to the tip of Maine. On the first day you march 20 miles, making \nit out of town.  \nOn the second day you march 20 miles. And again, on the third day you march 20 miles, heading into the  heat \nof the desert. It\u2019s hot, more than 100\u02daF, and you want to rest in the cool of your tent. But you don\u2019t. You get up \nand you march 20 miles.  \nYou keep the pace, 20 miles a day.  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Then the weather cools, and you\u2019re in comfortable conditions with the wind a t your back, and you could go \nmuch farther. But you hold back, modulating your effort. You stick with your 20 miles.  \nThen you reach the Colorado high mountains and get hit by snow, wind, and temperatures below zero \u2014 and all \nyou want to do is stay in your tent. But you get up. You get dressed. You march your 20 miles.  \nYou keep up the effort \u2014 20 miles, 20 miles, 20 miles \u2014 then you cross into the plains, and it\u2019s glorious \nspringtime, and you can go 40 or 50 miles in a day. But you don\u2019t. You sustain your pa ce, marching 20 miles.  \nAnd eventually, you get to Maine.  \nNow, imagine another person who starts out with you on the same day in San Diego. He gets all excited by the \njourney and logs 40 miles the first day.  \n \nExha usted from his first gigantic day, he wakes up to \n100\u02da temperatures. He decides to hang out until the \nweather cools, thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll make it up when \nconditions improve.\u201d He maintains this pattern \u2014 big \ndays with good conditions, whining and waiting in his \ntent on bad days \u2014 as he moves across the western \nUnited States.  \nJust before the Colorado high mountains, he gets a spate \nof great weather and he goes all out, logging 40 - to 50 -\nmile days to make up lost ground. But then he hits a \nhuge winter storm when ut terly exhausted. It nearly kills \nhim and he hunkers down in his tent, waiting for spring.  \nWhen spring finally comes, he emerges, weakened, and stumbles off toward Maine. By the time he enters \nKansas City, you, with your relentless 20 -mile march, have alrea dy reached the tip of Maine. You win, by a \nhuge margin.  \nNow, think of medical -equipment maker Stryker as a 20 -Mile March company.  \nWhen J ohn Brown became CEO of Stryker in 1977, he deliberately set a performance benchmark to drive \nconsistent progress: Stryker would achieve 20% net income growth every year. Th is was more than a mere \ntarget, or a wish, or a hope, or a dream, or a vision. It was, to use Brown\u2019s own words, \u201cthe law.\u201d He ingrained \n\u201cthe law\u201d into the company\u2019s culture, making it a way of life. (Twenty percent may seem like a high bar, but for \na smal l company in an explosive industry, it was achievable.)  \nBrown created the \u201cSnorkel Award,\u201d given to those who lagged behind; 20% was the watermark, and if you \nwere below it, you needed a snorkel. Just imagine receiving a mounted snorkel from John Brown to hang on \nyour wall so everyone can see that you\u2019re in danger of drowning. People worked hard to keep the snorkel off \ntheir walls.  \nStryker\u2019s annual division -review meetings included a chairman\u2019s breakfast. Those who hit their 20 -Mile March \nwent to John Brown \u2019s breakfast table. Those who didn\u2019t went to another breakfast. \u201cThey are well fed,\u201d said \nBrown, \u201cbut it is not the one where you want to go.\u201d  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.If your division fell behind for two years in a row, Brown would insert \nhimself to \u201chelp,\u201d working around the clo ck to \u201chelp\u201d you get back on \ntrack. \u201cWe\u2019ll arrive at an agreement as to what has to be done to correct the \nproblem,\u201d said the understated Brown. You get the distinct impression that \nyou really don\u2019t want to need John Brown\u2019s help. According to Investor\u2019s \nBusiness Daily , \u201cJohn Brown doesn\u2019t want to hear excuses. Markets bad? \nCurrency exchange rates are hurting results? Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Describing \nchallenges Stryker faced in Europe due partly to currency exchange rates, \nan analyst noted, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know ho w much of [the problem] was \nexternal. But at Stryker, that\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d  \nFrom the time John Brown became CEO in 1977 through 1998 (when its \ncomparison, USSC, disappeared as a public company), and excluding a \n1990 extraordinary gain, Stryker  hit its 20 -Mile March goal more than 90% \nof the time. Yet for all this self -imposed pressure, Stryker had an equally \nimportant self -imposed constraint: to never go too far, to never grow too \nmuch in a single year. Just imagine the pressure from Wall Street to \nincrease growth when your direct rival is growing faster than your \ncompany. In fact, Stryker grew more slowly than USSC more than half the time. Accord ing to the Wall Street \nTranscript , some observers criticized Brown for not being more aggressive. Brown, however, consciously chose \nto maintain the 20 -Mile March, regardless of criticism urging him to grow Stryker at a faster pace in boom \nyears.  \nJohn Brown  understood that if you want to achieve consistent performance, you need both parts of a 20 -Mile \nMarch: a lower bound and an upper bound, a hurdle that you jump over and a ceiling that you will not rise \nabove, the ambition to achieve and the self -control t o hold back.  \nSouthwest\u2019s radical restraint  \nWhen we began this study, we thought we might see 10X winners respond to a volatile, fast -changing world full \nof new opportunities by pursuing aggressive growth and making radical, big leaps, catching and riding the Next \nBig Wave, time and again. And yes, they did grow, and they did pursue spectacular opportunities as they grew. \nBut the less successful comparison cases pursued much more aggressive growth and undertook big -leap, \nradical -change adventures to a much greater degree than the 10X winners. The 10X cases exemplified what we \ncame to call the 20 -Mile March concept, hitting stepwise performance markers with great consistency over a \nlong period of time, and the comparison cases did not.  \nThe 20 -Mile Marc h is more than a philosophy. It\u2019s about having concrete, clear, intelligent, and rigorously \npursued performance mechanisms that keep you on track. The 20 -Mile March creates two types of self -imposed \ndiscomfort: (1) the discomfort of unwavering commitment t o high performance in difficult conditions, and (2) \nthe discomfort of holding back in good conditions.  \n \nSouthwest Airlines , for example, demanded of itself a profit every year , even when the entire industry lost \nmoney. From 1990 through 2003, the U.S. airline industry as a whole turned a profit in just six of 14 years. In \nthe early 1990s it lost $13 billion and furloughed more than 100,000 employees; Southwest remained profitab le \nand furloughed not a single person. Despite an almost chronic epidemic of airline troubles, including high -\nprofile bankruptcies of some major carriers, Southwest generated a profit every year for 30 consecutive years.  \nEqually important, Southwest had the discipline to hold back in good times so as not to extend beyond its ability \nto preserve profitability and the So uthwest culture. It didn\u2019t expand outside Texas until nearly eight years after \nstarting service, making a small jump to New Orleans. Southwest moved outward from Texas in deliberate steps \n\u2014 Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Los Angeles \u2014 and didn \u2019t reach the Eastern Seaboard until \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.almost a quarter of a century after its founding. In 1996 more than 100 cities clamored for Southwest service. \nAnd how many cities did Southwest open that year? Four.  \nAt first glance, this might not strike you as particu larly significant. But stop to think about it. Here we have an \nairline setting for itself a standard of consistent performance that no other airline achieves. Anyone who said \nthey\u2019d be profitable every year for nearly three decades in the airline business \u2014 the airline business! \u2014 would \nbe laughed at. No one does that. But Southwest did. Here also we have a publicly traded company willing to \nleave growth on the table. How many business leaders of publicly traded companies have the ability to leave \ngobs of g rowth on the table, especially during boom times when competitors do not leave growth on the table? \nFew, indeed. But Southwest did that too.  \nSome people believe that a world characterized by radical change and disruptive forces no longer favors those \nwho e ngage in consistent 20 -Mile Marching. Yet the great irony is that when we examined just this type of out -\nof-control, fast -paced environment, we found that every 10X company \u2014 unlike their less -successful peers \u2014 \nexemplified the 20 -Mile March principle duri ng the era we studied.  \nProgressive\u2019s marching mantra  \nIn the early 1970s, Progressive Insurance CEO Peter Lewis articulated a stringent performance metric: \nProgressive should grow only at a rate at which it could still sustain exemplary customer service and  achieve a \nprofitable \u201ccombined ratio\u201d averaging 96%. What does a combined ratio of 96% mean? If you sell $100 of \ninsurance, you should need to pay out no more than $96 in losses plus overhead combined. The combined ratio \ncaptures the central challenge for  the insurance business, pricing premiums at a rate that\u2019ll allow you to pay out \non losses, service customers, and earn a return. If a company lowers prices to increase growth, its combined \nratio could deteriorate. If it misjudges risks or mismanages its c laims service, its combined ratio will suffer. If \nthe combined ratio climbs over 100%, the company loses money on its insurance business.  \nProgressive\u2019s \u201cprofitable combined ratio\u201d mantra became like John Brown\u2019s 20% law, a rigorous standard to \naccomplish y ear in and year out. Progressive\u2019s stance: If competitors lower rates in an unprofitable bid to \nincrease share \u2014 fine, let them do so! We will not chase them into senseless self -destruction. Progressive had \nan unequivocal commitment to the profitable combi ned ratio, no matter what conditions it faced, how its \ncompetitors behaved, or what seductive growth opportunities beckoned. Said Lewis in 1972: \u201cThere is no \nexcuse, not regulatory problems, not competitive difficulties, not natural disaster, for failing t o do so.\u201d \nProgressive achieved a profitable combined ratio 27 out of 30 years, 1972 -2002, and averaged just better than \nits 96% target.  \nDo you need to accomplish your 20 -Mile March with 100% success? Progressive and its fellow 10X companies \ndidn\u2019t have a p erfect record, only a near -perfect record, but they never saw missing a march as \u201cokay.\u201d If they \nmissed it even once, they obsessed over what they needed to do to get back on track: There\u2019s no excuse, and it\u2019s \nup to us to correct for our failures, period.  \nThe 20 -Mile March imposes order amid disorder, consistency amid swirling inconsistency. But it works only if \nyou actually achieve your march year after year. If you set a 20 -Mile March and then fail to achieve it \u2014 or \nworse, abandon fanatic discipline alto gether \u2014 you may well get crushed by events.  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited. \n \n \nWhy 20 -Mile Marchers win  \nTwenty -Mile Marching helps turn the odds in your f avor for three reasons. First, it builds confidence in your \nability to perform well in adverse circumstances. Confidence comes not from motivational speeches, \ncharismatic inspiration, wild pep rallies, unfounded optimism, or blind hope. Taciturn, understat ed, and \nreserved, John Brown at Stryker avoided all of that. Stryker earned its confidence by actual achievement, \naccomplishing stringent performance standards year in and year out, no matter the industry conditions. \nAccomplishing a 20 -Mile March, consiste ntly, in good times and bad, builds confidence. Tangible achievement \nin the face of adversity reinforces the 10X perspective: We are ultimately responsible for improving \nperformance. We never blame circumstance; we never blame the environment.  \nSecond, 20 -Mile Marching reduces the likelihood of catastrophe when you\u2019re hit by turbulent disruption. In a \nsetting characterized by unpredictability, full of immense threat and opportunity, you cannot afford to leave \nyourself exposed to unforeseen events. If you\u2019re hiking in the warm, comfortable glow of a spring day on a \nnice, wide, wandering trail near your home, you can overextend yourself and you might need to take two Advil \nto soothe your sore muscles when you\u2019re done. But if you\u2019re climbing in the Himalayas or journeying to the \nSouth Pole, going too far can have much more severe consequences from which you might never recover. You \ncan get away with failing to 20 -Mile March in stable times for a while, but doing so leaves you weak and \nundisciplined, and therefore  exposed when unstable times come. And they will always come.  \nThird, 20 -Mile Marching helps you exert self -control in an out -of-control environment.  \nOn Dec. 12, 1911, Amundsen and his team reached a point 45 miles from the South Pole. He had no idea of \nScott\u2019s whereabouts. Scott had taken a different route slightly to the west, so for all Amundsen knew, Scott was \nahead of him. The weather had turned clear and calm, and sitting high on the smooth Polar Plateau, Amundsen \nhad perfect ski and sled conditions fo r the remainder of the journey to the South Pole. Amundsen noted, \u201cGoing \nand surface as good as ever. Weather splendid \u2014 calm with sunshine.\u201d His team had journeyed more than 650 \nmiles, carving a path straight over a mountain range, climbing from sea level  to over 10,000 feet. And now, \nwith the anxiety of \u201cWhere\u2019s Scott?\u201d gnawing away, his team could reach its goal within 24 hours in one hard \npush.  \nAnd what did Amundsen do?  \nHe went 17 miles.  \nThroughout the journey, Amundsen adhered to a regimen of consisten t progress, never going too far in good \nweather, careful to stay far away from the red line of exhaustion that could leave his team exposed, yet pressing \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.ahead in nasty weather to stay on pace. Amundsen throttled back his well -tuned team to travel between 15 and \n20 miles per day, in a relentless march to 90\u02dasouth. When a member of Amundsen\u2019s team suggested they could \ngo faster, up to 25 miles a day, Amundsen said no. They needed to rest and sleep so as to continually replenish \ntheir energy.  \nIn contrast, Sco tt would sometimes drive his team to exhaustion on good days and then sit in his tent and \ncomplain about the weather on bad days. In early December, Scott wrote in his journal about being stopped by a \nblizzard: \u201cI doubt if any party could travel in such we ather.\u201d But when Amundsen faced conditions comparable \nto Scott\u2019s, he wrote in his journal, \u201cIt has been an unpleasant day \u2014 storm, drift, and frostbite, but we have \nadvanced 13 miles closer to our goal.\u201d Amundsen clocked in at the South Pole right on pace,  having averaged \n15\u00bd miles per day.  \nLike Amundsen and his team, the 10Xers and their companies use their 20 -Mile Marches as a way to exert self -\ncontrol, even when afraid or tempted by opportunity. Having a clear 20 -Mile March focuses the mind; because \neveryone on the team knows the markers and their importance, they can stay on track. While it is not the only \nleadership method we found in our research \u2014 Great by Choice  delineates fully six sets of findings \u2014 20-Mile \nMarch is the crucial starting point.  \nFinancial markets are out of your control. Customers are out of your control. Earthquakes are out of your \ncontrol. Global competition is out of your control. Technological change is out of your control. Most everything \nis ultimately out of your control. But wh en you 20 -Mile March, you have a tangible point of focus that keeps \nyou and your team moving forward, despite confusion, uncertainty, and even chaos.  \nThis article is from the October 17, 2011 issue of Fortune . \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.",

Focusing inward and focusing construc-\ntively on others helps leaders cultivate the primary \nelements of emotional intelligence. A fuller under -\nstanding of how they focus on the wider world can \nimprove their ability to devise strategy, innovate, \nand manage organizations.\nEvery leader needs to cultivate this triad of \nawareness, in abundance and in the proper balance, \nbecause a failure to focus inward leaves you rudder-\nless, a failure to focus on others renders you clue-\nless, and a failure to focus outward may leave you \nblindsided. \nFocusing on Yourself\nEmotional intelligence begins with self-awareness\u2014\ngetting in touch with your inner voice. Leaders who \nheed their inner voices can draw on more resources To do so, leaders must learn to focus their own attention. \nWhen we speak about being focused, we commonly mean \nthinking about one thing while filtering out distractions. \nBut a wealth of recent research in neuroscience shows that \nwe focus in many ways, for different purposes, drawing on \ndifferent neural pathways\u2014some of which work in concert, \nwhile others tend to stand in opposition.\nto make better decisions and connect with their au-thentic selves. But what does that entail? A look at \nhow people focus inward can make this abstract con-\ncept more concrete. \nSelf-awareness.  Hearing your inner voice is a \nmatter of paying careful attention to internal physi-\nological signals. These subtle cues are monitored by \nthe insula, which is tucked behind the frontal lobes \nof the brain. Attention given to any part of the body \namps up the insula\u2019s sensitivity to that part. Tune \nin to your heartbeat, and the insula activates more \nneurons in that circuitry. How well people can sense \ntheir heartbeats has, in fact, become a standard way to measure their self-awareness. \nGut feelings are messages from the insula and the \namygdala, which the neuroscientist Antonio Dama-\nsio, of the University of Southern California, calls so-\nmatic markers. Those messages are sensations that \nsomething \u201cfeels\u201d right or wrong. Somatic markers simplify decision making by guiding our attention \ntoward better options.

(See \u201cAre You \nSkimming This Sidebar?\u201d)\nConsider, for example, the implications of an \nanalysis of interviews conducted by a group of Brit -\nish researchers with 118 professional traders and 10 \nsenior managers at four City of London investment \nbanks. The most successful traders (whose annual \nincome averaged \u00a3500,000) were neither the ones \nwho relied entirely on analytics nor the ones who \njust went with their guts. They focused on a full \nrange of emotions, which they used to judge the \nvalue of their intuition. When they suffered losses, \nthey acknowledged their anxiety, became more \ncautious, and took fewer risks. The least success-\nful traders (whose income averaged only \u00a3100,000) \ntended to ignore their anxiety and keep going with \ntheir guts. Because they failed to heed a wider array \nof internal signals, they were misled. \nZeroing in on sensory impressions of ourselves in \nthe moment is one major element of self-awareness.  \nBut another is critical to leadership: combining our \nexperiences across time into a coherent view of our \nauthentic selves. \nTo be authentic is to be the same person to oth-\ners as you are to yourself. In part that entails paying \nattention to what others think of you, particularly \npeople whose opinions you esteem and who will be \ncandid in their feedback. A variety of focus that is \nuseful here is open awareness, in which we broadly \nnotice what\u2019s going on around us without getting \ncaught up in or swept away by any particular thing. \nIn this mode we don\u2019t judge, censor, or tune out; we \nsimply perceive. \nLeaders who are more accustomed to giving in-\nput than to receiving it may find this tricky.

(See the sidebar \u201cExpand \nYour Awareness. \u201d)\nOf course, being open to input doesn\u2019t guarantee \nthat someone will provide it. Sadly, life affords us \nfew chances to learn how others really see us, and \neven fewer for executives as they rise through the \nranks. That may be why one of the most popular and \noverenrolled courses at Harvard Business School is \nBill George\u2019s Authentic Leadership Development, in \nwhich George has created what he calls True North \ngroups to heighten this aspect of self-awareness. \nThese groups (which anyone can form) are based \non the precept that self-knowledge begins with self-\nrevelation. Accordingly, they are open and intimate, \n\u201ca safe place, \u201d George explains, \u201cwhere members can \ndiscuss personal issues they do not feel they can raise \nelsewhere\u2014often not even with their closest family \nmembers. \u201d What good does that do? \u201cWe don\u2019t know \nwho we are until we hear ourselves speaking the \nstory of our lives to those we trust, \u201d George says. It\u2019s \na structured way to match our view of our true selves \nwith the views our most trusted colleagues have\u2014an \nexternal check on our authenticity. \nSelf-control. \u201cCognitive control\u201d is the scientific \nterm for putting one\u2019s attention where one wants it \nand keeping it there in the face of temptation to wan-\nder. This focus is one aspect of the brain\u2019s executive \nfunction, which is located in the prefrontal cortex. A \ncolloquial term for it is \u201cwillpower. \u201d \nCognitive control enables executives to pursue \na goal despite distractions and setbacks. The same \nneural circuitry that allows such a single-minded \npursuit of goals also manages unruly emotions. \nGood cognitive control can be seen in people who \nstay calm in a crisis, tame their own agitation, and \nrecover from a debacle or defeat. \nDecades\u2019 worth of research demonstrates the sin-\ngular importance of willpower to leadership success. Particularly compelling is a longitudinal study track -\ning the fates of all 1,037 children born during a single \nyear in the 1970s in the New Zealand city of Dunedin. \nFor several years during childhood the children were \ngiven a battery of tests of willpower, including the \npsychologist Walter Mischel\u2019s legendary \u201cmarshmal-\nlow test\u201d\u2014a choice between eating one marshmal-\nlow right away and getting two by waiting 15 minutes. \nIn Mischel\u2019s experiments, roughly a third of children \ngrab the marshmallow on the spot, another third \nhold out for a while longer, and a third manage to make it through the entire quarter hour. \nYears later, when the children in the Dunedin \nstudy were in their 30s and all but 4% of them had \nbeen tracked down again, the researchers found that \nthose who\u2019d had the cognitive control to resist the \nmarshmallow longest were significantly healthier, more successful financially, and more law-abiding \nthan the ones who\u2019d been unable to hold out at all. \nIn fact, statistical analysis showed that a child\u2019s \nlevel of self-control was a more powerful predictor \nof financial success than IQ, social class, or family circumstance. \nHow we focus holds the key to exercising will-\npower, Mischel says. Three subvarieties of cognitive \ncontrol are at play when you pit self-restraint against \nself-gratification: the ability to voluntarily disen-\ngage your focus from an object of desire; the ability \nto resist distraction so that you don\u2019t gravitate back to that object; and the ability to concentrate on the \nfuture goal and imagine how good you will feel when \nyou achieve it. As adults the children of Dunedin \nmay have been held hostage to their younger selves, \nbut they need not have been, because the power to \nfocus can be developed.

We talk about empathy \nmost commonly as a single attribute. But a close look \nat where leaders are focusing when they exhibit it re-\nveals three distinct kinds, each important for leader-\nship effectiveness: \n\u2022 cognitive empathy\u2014the ability to understand \nanother person\u2019s perspective; \n\u2022 emotional empathy\u2014the ability to feel what \nsomeone else feels; \n\u2022 empathic concern\u2014the ability to sense what \nanother person needs from you.\nCognitive empathy enables leaders to explain \nthemselves in meaningful ways\u2014a skill essential to \ngetting the best performance from their direct re-\nports. Contrary to what you might expect, exercising \ncognitive empathy requires leaders to think about \nfeelings rather than to feel them directly. \nAn inquisitive nature feeds cognitive empathy. As \none successful executive with this trait puts it, \u201cI\u2019ve \nalways just wanted to learn everything, to under-\nstand anybody that I was around\u2014why they thought \nwhat they did, why they did what they did, what \nworked for them, and what didn\u2019t work. \u201d But cogni-\ntive empathy is also an outgrowth of self-awareness. \nThe executive circuits that allow us to think about \nour own thoughts and to monitor the feelings that \nflow from them let us apply the same reasoning to \nother people\u2019s minds when we choose to direct our \nattention that way. \nEmotional empathy is important for effective \nmentoring, managing clients, and reading group dy -\nnamics. It springs from ancient parts of the brain be-neath the cortex\u2014the amygdala, the hypothalamus, \nthe hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex\u2014that \nallow us to feel fast without thinking deeply. They \ntune us in by arousing in our bodies the emotional \nstates of others: I literally feel your pain. My brain \npatterns match up with yours when I listen to you \ntell a gripping story. As Tania Singer, the director \nof the social neuroscience department at the Max \nPlanck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sci-\nences, in Leipzig, says, \u201cYou need to understand \nyour own feelings to understand the feelings of oth-Just as a camera lens can be set narrowly on a \nsingle point or more widely to take in a panoramic \nview, you can focus tightly or expansively.\nOne measure of open awareness presents people with a stream of \nletters and numbers, such as s, k, O, E, 4, R, t, 2, H, p. In scanning the \nstream, many people will notice the first number, 4, but after that their \nattention blinks. those firmly in open awareness mode will register the \nsecond number as well. \nstrengthening the ability to maintain open awareness requires leaders \nto do something that verges on the unnatural: cultivate at least some-\ntimes a willingness to not be in control, not offer up their own views, not \njudge others. that\u2019s less a matter of deliberate action than of attitude \nadjustment.\nOne path to making that adjustment is through the classic power of \npositive thinking, because pessimism narrows our focus, whereas posi-\ntive emotions widen our attention and our receptiveness to the new and \nunexpected. a simple way to shift into positive mode is to ask yourself, \u201cIf \neverything worked out perfectly in my life, what would I be doing in 10 \nyears?\u201d Why is that effective? Because when you\u2019re in an upbeat mood, the \nUniversity of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard davidson has found, your \nbrain\u2019s left prefrontal area lights up. that area harbors the circuitry that \nreminds us how great we\u2019ll feel when we reach some long-sought goal. \n\u201ctalking about positive goals and dreams activates brain centers that \nopen you up to new possibilities,\u201d says Richard Boyatzis, a psychologist at \nCase Western Reserve. \u201cBut if you change the conversation to what you \nshould do to fix yourself, it closes you down\u2026. you need the negative to \nsurvive, but the positive to thrive.\u201d Expand Y our Awareness\nFor ar Ticle reprin Ts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or visi T hBr.org\ndecember 2013\u2002Harvard Business Review\u20027\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.ers. \u201d Accessing your capacity for emotional empathy \ndepends on combining two kinds of attention: a de-\nliberate focus on your own echoes of someone else\u2019s \nfeelings and an open awareness of that person\u2019s face, \nvoice, and other external signs of emotion.

It\u2019s \nwhat you want in your doctor, your spouse\u2014and \nyour boss. Empathic concern has its roots in the cir-\ncuitry that compels parents\u2019 attention to their chil-\ndren. Watch where people\u2019s eyes go when someone \nbrings an adorable baby into a room, and you\u2019ll see \nthis mammalian brain center leaping into action.One neural theory holds that the response is trig-\ngered in the amygdala by the brain\u2019s radar for sens-\ning danger and in the prefrontal cortex by the release \nof oxytocin, the chemical for caring. This implies \nthat empathic concern is a double-edged feeling. \nWe intuitively experience the distress of another as \nour own. But in deciding whether we will meet that \nperson\u2019s needs, we deliberately weigh how much we \nvalue his or her well-being. \nGetting this intuition-deliberation mix right has \ngreat implications. Those whose sympathetic feel-\nings become too strong may themselves suffer. In \nthe helping professions, this can lead to compassion \nfatigue; in executives, it can create distracting feel-\nings of anxiety about people and circumstances that \nare beyond anyone\u2019s control. But those who protect \nthemselves by deadening their feelings may lose \ntouch with empathy. Empathic concern requires \nus to manage our personal distress without numb -\ning ourselves to the pain of others. (See the sidebar \n\u201cWhen Empathy Needs to Be Controlled. \u201d) \nWhat\u2019s more, some lab research suggests that \nthe appropriate application of empathic concern \nis critical to making moral judgments. Brain scans \nhave revealed that when volunteers listened to tales \nof people subjected to physical pain, their own brain centers for experiencing such pain lit up instantly. \nBut if the story was about psychological suffering, \nthe higher brain centers involved in empathic con-\ncern and compassion took longer to activate. Some \ntime is needed to grasp the psychological and moral \ndimensions of a situation. The more distracted we \nare, the less we can cultivate the subtler forms of \nempathy and compassion. \nBuilding relationships.  People who lack social \nsensitivity are easy to spot\u2014at least for other peo -\nple. They are the clueless among us.

(In another age \nthis might have been called good manners.) \nCircuitry that converges on the anterior hippo -\ncampus reads social context and leads us intuitively \nto act differently with, say, our college buddies than \nwith our families or our colleagues. In concert with \nthe deliberative prefrontal cortex, it squelches the \nimpulse to do something inappropriate. Accordingly, \none brain test for sensitivity to context assesses the \nfunction of the hippocampus. The University of \nWisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson hypoth-\nesizes that people who are most alert to social situa -\ntions exhibit stronger activity and more connections \nbetween the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex \nthan those who just can\u2019t seem to get it right. \nThe same circuits may be at play when we map \nsocial networks in a group\u2014a skill that lets us navi-\ngate the relationships in those networks well. People \nwho excel at organizational influence can not only \nsense the flow of personal connections but also \nname the people whose opinions hold most sway, \nand so focus on persuading those who will persuade \nothers.\nAlarmingly, research suggests that as people rise \nthrough the ranks and gain power, their ability to \nperceive and maintain personal connections tends \nto suffer a sort of psychic attrition. In studying en -\ncounters between people of varying status, Dacher \nKeltner, a psychologist at Berkeley, has found that \nhigher-ranking individuals consistently focus their \ngaze less on lower-ranking people and are more \nlikely to interrupt or to monopolize the conversation. \nIn fact, mapping attention to power in an orga-\nnization gives a clear indication of hierarchy: The \nlonger it takes Person A to respond to Person B, the \nmore relative power Person A has. Map response \ntimes across an entire organization, and you\u2019ll get \na remarkably accurate chart of social standing. The \nboss leaves e-mails unanswered for hours; those \nlower down respond within minutes. This is so pre-\ndictable that an algorithm for it\u2014called automated \nsocial hierarchy detection\u2014has been developed at \nColumbia University. Intelligence agencies report -\nedly are applying the algorithm to suspected terror-\nist gangs to piece together chains of influence and \nidentify central figures.\nBut the real point is this: Where we see ourselves \non the social ladder sets the default for how much \nattention we pay. This should be a warning to top \nexecutives, who need to respond to fast-moving competitive situations by tapping the full range of Learning Self-Restraint \nQuick, now.

When it\u2019s taken under laboratory conditions, differences of a \nthousandth of a second can be detected in the speed with which subjects \nperceive which direction the middle arrows are pointing. the stronger their \ncognitive control, the less susceptible they are to distraction.\nInterventions to strengthen cognitive control can be as unsophisticated \nas a game of simon says or Red light\u2014any exercise in which you are asked \nto stop on cue.

In these sessions you focus your attention on your breathing and \npractice tracking your thoughts and feelings without getting swept away \nby them.

Any business school \ncourse on strategy will give you the two main ele-\nments: exploitation of your current advantage and \nexploration for new ones. Brain scans that were per-\nformed on 63 seasoned business decision makers as \nthey pursued or switched between exploitative and \nexploratory strategies revealed the specific circuits \ninvolved. Not surprisingly, exploitation requires \nconcentration on the job at hand, whereas explo -\nration demands open awareness to recognize new \npossibilities. But exploitation is accompanied by \nactivity in the brain\u2019s circuitry for anticipation and \nreward. In other words, it feels good to coast along \nin a familiar routine. When we switch to exploration, \nwe have to make a deliberate cognitive effort to dis-engage from that routine in order to roam widely and \npursue fresh paths.\nWhat keeps us from making that effort? Sleep  \ndeprivation, drinking, stress, and mental overload all \ninterfere with the executive circuitry used to make \nthe cognitive switch. To sustain the outward focus \nthat leads to innovation, we need some uninter-\nrupted time in which to reflect and refresh our focus.\nThe wellsprings of innovation.  In an era when \nalmost everyone has access to the same informa-\ntion, new value arises from putting ideas together \nin novel ways and asking smart questions that open \nup untapped potential. Moments before we have a \ncreative insight, the brain shows a third-of-a-second \nspike in gamma waves, indicating the synchrony \nof far-flung brain cells. The more neurons firing in \nsync, the bigger the spike. Its timing suggests that \nwhat\u2019s happening is the formation of a new neural \nnetwork\u2014presumably creating a fresh association.\nBut it would be making too much of this to see \ngamma waves as a secret to creativity. A classic \nmodel of creativity suggests how the various modes \nof attention play key roles. First we prepare our \nminds by gathering a wide variety of pertinent infor-mation, and then we alternate between concentrat -\ning intently on the problem and letting our minds \nwander freely. Those activities translate roughly \ninto vigilance, when while immersing ourselves in \nall kinds of input, we remain alert for anything rel-\nevant to the problem at hand; selective attention to \nthe specific creative challenge; and open awareness, \nin which we allow our minds to associate freely and \nthe solution to emerge spontaneously. (That\u2019s why \nso many fresh ideas come to people in the shower or \nout for a walk or a run.) \nThe dubious gift of systems awareness.  If \npeople are given a quick view of a photo of lots of \ndots and asked to guess how many there are, the \nstrong systems thinkers in the group tend to make \nthe best estimates. This skill shows up in those who \nare good at designing software, assembly lines, ma-\ntrix organizations, or interventions to save failing \necosystems\u2014it\u2019s a very powerful gift indeed. After \nall, we live within extremely complex systems. But, \nsuggests the Cambridge University psychologist Si-\nmon Baron-Cohen (a cousin of Sacha\u2019s), in a small \nbut significant number of people, a strong systems \nawareness is coupled with an empathy deficit\u2014a \nblind spot for what other people are thinking and \nfeeling and for reading social situations.

That way, \nthe bank can consult them as needed while recruit -\ning leaders from a different pool\u2014one containing \npeople with emotional intelligence. \nPutting it all Together\nFor those who don\u2019t want to end up similarly com-\npartmentalized, the message is clear. A focused \nleader is not the person concentrating on the three \nmost important priorities of the year, or the most \nbrilliant systems thinker, or the one most in tune \nwith the corporate culture. Focused leaders can \ncommand the full range of their own attention: They \nare in touch with their inner feelings, they can con-\ntrol their impulses, they are aware of how others see \nthem, they understand what others need from them, they can weed out distractions and also allow their \nminds to roam widely, free of preconceptions.\nThis is challenging. But if great leadership were a \npaint-by-numbers exercise, great leaders would be \nmore common. Practically every form of focus can \nbe strengthened. What it takes is not talent so much \nas diligence\u2014a willingness to exercise the attention \ncircuits of the brain just as we exercise our analytic \nskills and other systems of the body.\nThe link between attention and excellence re-\nmains hidden most of the time. Yet attention is the \nbasis of the most essential of leadership skills\u2014emo -\ntional, organizational, and strategic intelligence. And \nnever has it been under greater assault. The constant \nonslaught of incoming data leads to sloppy short -\ncuts\u2014triaging our e-mail by reading only the subject \nlines, skipping many of our voice mails, skimming \nmemos and reports. Not only do our habits of atten-\ntion make us less effective, but the sheer volume of \nall those messages leaves us too little time to reflect \non what they really mean. This was foreseen more \nthan 40 years ago by the Nobel Prize\u2013winning econ-\nomist Herbert Simon. Information \u201cconsumes the at -\ntention of its recipients, \u201d he wrote in 1971. \u201cHence a \nwealth of information creates a poverty of attention. \u201d \nMy goal here is to place attention center stage so \nthat you can direct it where you need it when you \nneed it.

But physicians learn in medical school \nto block even such automatic responses. their attentional \nanesthetic seems to be deployed by the temporal-parietal \njunction and regions of the prefrontal cortex, a circuit that \nboosts concentration by tuning out emotions. that\u2019s what \nis happening in your brain when you distance yourself from \nothers in order to stay calm and help them. the same neural \nnetwork kicks in when we see a problem in an emotionally \noverheated environment and need to focus on looking for a \nsolution.

Maybe it\u2019s about a project that\u2019s gone \noff track or a manager who\u2019s behaving badly. \nOr maybe they\u2019re not sharing their thoughts \non ways the business could grow its sales or \nimprove operations. No matter how open you \nare as a manager, our research shows, many of \nyour people are more likely to keep mum than to \nquestion initiatives or suggest new ideas at work.\nnational restaurant chain, managers were able to \npersuade senior leaders to make improvements that \nreduced employee turnover by 32% and saved at \nleast $1.6  million a year. \nSo getting all this right pays off\u2014not just for the \nindividuals eager to make contributions but for the \norganizations they want to improve.\nThe Fear Factor\nIt doesn\u2019t take a tyrannical boss to inspire fear within \nan organization. Nor does it matter if an unsettling \nevent like a restructuring or a takeover happened \nlong ago. Once people become afraid to speak their \nminds, they\u2019ll keep justifying their silence with ex \u2011\nplanations like \u201cThat\u2019s the way our culture is\u2014you \ndon\u2019t disagree with your boss. \u201d \nWithout realizing it, leaders tend to make the \nproblem worse with the following practices: \nRelying on anonymous feedback.  The prom \u2011\nise of anonymity is a common way to encourage \nfrank input. Suggestion boxes, whistle \u2011blowing hot \u2011\nlines, ombudspeople, 360 \u2011degree assessments, and \nsatisfaction surveys all serve this purpose. Here\u2019s the \nlogic: If no one knows who said what, no repercus \u2011\nsions will follow, so people can be forthright about \nany topic.\nThis line of reasoning has three flaws.\nFirst, allowing employees to remain unidentified \nactually underscores the risks of speaking up\u2014and \nreinforces people\u2019s fears. The subtext is \u201cIt\u2019s not safe \nto share your views openly in this organization. So This is true even if, like most leaders, you be \u2011\nlieve you have an open \u2011door policy. (In our years \nof studying employee \u201cvoice\u201d and advising orga \u2011\nnizations, we\u2019ve never heard anyone say, \u201cI have a \nclosed \u2011door policy. \u201d) Think about it: How often do \nemployees come to you, on your turf, to tell you \nthe unvarnished truth simply because you\u2019ve en \u2011\ncouraged them to do so? The reality is, they worry\u2014\nrightly or not\u2014that you\u2019ll take their comments per \u2011\nsonally, or that they\u2019ll come across as disrespectful \nknow \u2011it\u2011alls. \nLeaders use a variety of tools to get people to \nspeak up, like \u201cclimate\u201d surveys and all \u2011staff feed \u2011\nback sessions. Many of these efforts focus on improv \u2011\ning communication up and down the hierarchy. But \nthey usually fall short, regardless of good intentions, \nfor two key reasons: a fear of consequences (embar \u2011\nrassment, isolation, low performance ratings, lost \npromotions, and even firing) and a sense of futility \n(the belief that saying something won\u2019t make a differ \u2011\nence, so why bother?). Here, we\u2019ll look at how lead \u2011\ners\u2019 misguided attempts to promote candor fail to ad \u2011\ndress\u2014and sometimes stir up\u2014those feelings. We\u2019ll \nalso discuss tactics that are much more effective. \nIn a number of studies, we\u2019ve found that when \nemployees can voice their concerns freely, organi \u2011\nzations see increased retention and stronger per \u2011\nformance. At several financial services firms, for \nexample, business units whose employees reported \nspeaking up more had significantly better financial \nand operational results than others.

That \nwas a theme at one Fortune  500 company we stud \u2011\nied. When employees provided negative feedback \nthrough hotlines, suggestion boxes, and such, some \nbosses demanded to know \u201cWho said this?!\u201d People \nin other organizations had similar experiences. \nMany told us that they go to libraries and coffee \nshops and use public computers to complete online \nemployee surveys\u2014because they worry they\u2019ll be \ntracked through their IP addresses otherwise. One \nman said he wouldn\u2019t even report a problem to an \nombudsperson. When asked why, he countered, \n\u201cWho pays his salary?\u201d \nThird and perhaps most important, it can be dif \u2011\nficult to address issues while protecting the identity \nof the people who raised them. Reporting in a survey \nthat a manager acts abusively, incompetently, or in \nracist or sexist ways won\u2019t do any good unless HR \nor an ombudsperson can assess the extent of the \nproblem, explore the causes, and develop recom \u2011\nmendations. That means interviews need to be con \u2011\nducted, stories corroborated, and additional data \ncollected\u2014all of which involve talking to the person \nwho has accused the manager of wrongdoing. And if a complaint refers to a specific incident, it\u2019s often \nquite clear to the manager which person filed it.\nIssuing general invitations to come forward. \nOpen doors and attitudes are simply too passive. \nPeople still have to approach you to initiate a conver \u2011\nsation, and that\u2019s intimidating.\nIn a U.S. \u2011based call center at a Fortune  500 insur \u2011\nance company, for example, frontline employees \nhad a very nice manager who expressed interest and \neven took action when people raised issues. Yet call \ncenter staffers hardly ever brought him script prob \u2011\nlems, ideas for improving efficiency, or suggestions \nfor cross \u2011selling. Why not? Because his office was on \nanother floor, and getting to him involved walking \nthrough four closed  doors and past three secretar \u2011\nies. The hundreds of employees under him almost \nnever saw him, so they didn\u2019t feel they knew him \nand weren\u2019t comfortable approaching him. \n\u201cBut my people come tell me things, \u201d you may be \nthinking. Fair enough, though there may be other \nthings they aren\u2019t coming to you about\u2014issues that \nfeel less safe.

It seemed to convey \nthat he took more time with people and cared about \nthem, even though his other behavior changed \nvery little. The next month, his patient satisfaction \nscores soared. \nThe Futility Factor\nIn many organizations we\u2019ve studied, the biggest \nreason for withholding ideas and concerns wasn\u2019t \nfear but, rather, the belief that managers wouldn\u2019t \ndo anything about them anyway. At one Fortune  100 \nhigh \u2011tech company, employees cited futility as a rea \u2011\nson for reticence almost twice as often as fear. \nThis \u201cwhy bother?\u201d attitude stems from\u2014and \npersists because of\u2014these leadership behaviors: \nFailing to model free expression. When lead \u2011\ners themselves aren\u2019t vocal, their employees take \nnote. One of us saw this while serving as an external \nresearcher on a task force of senior managers at a \nlarge science\u2011driven company. Charged with under \u2011\nstanding the causes of employee silence and then \nproposing solutions, the task force conducted more \nthan 200 interviews across many sites and at all lev \u2011\nels. But when it came time to present the findings to \nthe CEO and the division presidents, the task force \nmembers failed to report how often they had heard \nabout top management\u2019s candor \u2011inhibiting behavior. this out. In it, one group of randomly assigned re \u2011\nspondents are asked to imagine they\u2019re on a multi \u2011\nfunctional team developing a new product. They\u2019re \ntold that the project keeps hitting major technical \nproblems and that they ought to recommend end \u2011\ning it before it becomes a disaster. A second group \nare told the same thing but get one additional piece \nof information: Their boss has invested a lot of time \nin the project. Individuals in this group are signifi \u2011\ncantly less likely to speak up, we\u2019ve found. As one \npointed out, frankness might wound or provoke the \nboss. \u201cThe old saying is \u2018Don\u2019t kill the messenger, \u2019\u201d \nhe added, \u201cbut usually the messenger gets killed. \u201d \nSending signals that you\u2019re in charge. \nWhether you realize it or not, you\u2019re probably con \u2011\nveying your power through subtle cues (social psy \u2011\nchologist Richard Hackman called them \u201cambient \nstimuli\u201d). This can cause employees to clam up.\nWhen someone ventures into your office, do \nyou lean back in your chair with your arms clasped \nbehind your head? You may think you\u2019re setting \na relaxed tone, but you\u2019re really displaying domi \u2011\nnance. (The posture makes you look bigger, a tactic \nanimals and humans use to warn away others.)

Despite your \ngood intentions (\u201cCome on in!\u201d), you\u2019re inadver \u2011\ntently telling him to watch his step around you. \nWe\u2019ve seen the effects of subtle power cues in \nmany organizations.

This can make a lot of sense if you have time \nto synthesize the information and then take action. \nBut it can backfire if you don\u2019t. Suppose you\u2019re a \nnew manager brought in to lead an expansion into a \nnew region. You already have your marching orders. \nHolding a series of open \u2011ended meetings so that \npeople can tell you about all the other things they \nwish you\u2019d do or fix isn\u2019t going to change your main \npath. It\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time. \nProviding no resources to address issues. In \nour consulting work, we\u2019ve seen leaders in higher ed \u2011\nucation, financial services, retail, and other contexts \nwho spent thousands or millions of dollars collecting \nideas but then didn\u2019t allocate a single employee to \nread through the data, much less design a systematic \nevaluation process. Sometimes we transcribed and \nanalyzed the ideas according to their level of creativ \u2011\nity, feasibility, and apparent overall value, only to \nlearn that senior leaders had no intention of holding \npeople accountable for implementing the suggested \nimprovements. Or the company\u2019s leaders simply \nsaid they were too strapped to fund any new proj  ects. \nDevoting resources to collecting ideas without \nmaking commitments, financial and otherwise,  \nto see at least some of them to fruition can only lead \nto a sense that employee input will change nothing.\nCreating a More Vocal Culture \nThough leaders clearly struggle to get employees to \nspeak up, it can be done. From our research, we\u2019ve \ngleaned the following best practices:\nMake feedback a regular, casual exchange.  If \nyou ask for input frequently and hold the conversa \u2011\ntions face\u2011to\u2011face, idea sharing will feel less ominous \nand more natural. Schedule regular meetings with \nyour employees, and don\u2019t cancel every time you \ndon\u2019t have an agenda. In fact, you might occasionally \nannounce that the top item on the agenda will be em \u2011\nployee feedback. Tell people in advance what sort of \nconversation you\u2019ll be having (a brainstorming meet \u2011\ning, for instance, or a planning session), and explain \nthe kinds of problems or possibilities you want to dis \u2011\ncuss. That will give a sense of what\u2019s fair game. Also \nassure people that they needn\u2019t make an ironclad \ncase for every suggestion, so they won\u2019t worry that \nthey\u2019ll look dumb or get in trouble if they don\u2019t have \nall the answers. When the first brave souls speak up, \nespecially with comments that challenge how things \nare done, thank them and publicly acknowledge how Sure enough, the top team approved a relatively \ntoothless set of recommendations and called it a \nday. Imagine how that felt to those 200 people who \nwere interviewed (and the thousands more who had \nfilled out the survey that led to the task force). Even \nspeaking up about speaking up had proved futile. \nAs more than one employee had predicted, senior \npeople couldn\u2019t be trusted to talk about the prover \u2011\nbial elephant in the room (in this case, top managers\u2019 \nnegative behavior). So why would others in the orga \u2011\nnization conclude that voicing concerns was worth \ntheir time?\nIf you don\u2019t share what you hear from below with \nyour higher \u2011ups, without excessive filtering or sugar \u2011\ncoating, your employees will stop wasting their own \nbreath. The same thing is likely to happen if they \nsee you sitting silently in meetings when they know \nyou\u2019ve got a mental list of problems or ideas that you \ncould be raising. Formal power comes with an expec \u2011\ntation that you\u2019ll be the voice of your subordinates \nand take action on their behalf. Failure to do so is a \nbig demotivator. \nBeing unclear about the input you want. \nLeaders are most responsive to ideas that support \ntheir own agendas. That\u2019s actually not a bad thing\u2014\nthey need to focus on their priorities to be effective. \nBut they also have a hard time admitting that they\u2019re \nnot interested in an idea, which results in \u201cpseudo \u2011\nparticipation\u201d\u2014going through the motions of listen \u2011\ning, with little intention of following up. They com \u2011\npound this problem by sending out vague calls for \nemployee feedback\u2014asking for a \u201csingle best idea\u201d \non a survey, for instance, or inviting people to speak \nup in meetings about whatever is on their minds. \nIf you cast that wide a net, what you reel in \nmight not mesh with what you\u2019re trying to accom \u2011\nplish. We\u2019ve found this discrepancy in service and \nhealth care settings: When asked what they\u2019d like to \nimprove, frontline employees tend to focus on cus \u2011\ntomer satisfaction, while their managers are looking \nfor ways to boost sales and reduce transaction times \n(in call centers) or to increase efficiency and protect \nagainst legal liability (in hospitals). If you don\u2019t spec \u2011\nify the kind of input you\u2019re seeking, you may end up \ndiscarding most of what people tell you\u2014and send \nthe message that it\u2019s useless for them to contribute \nideas. Frustration is inevitable.\nWhen leaders take on new roles or join new \norganizations, they often, as part of a \u201clistening \ntour, \u201d conduct surveys or individual interviews to \nJanuary\u2013February 2016 \u2002Harvard Business Review\u2002 7FOR ARTICLE REPRINTS CALL 800-988-0886 OR 617-783-7500, OR VISIT HBR.ORG\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.immediate network probably are similar to you \nin background, perspective, and knowledge\u2014so \nbranch out.

If you really want to get \nthe truth from below, play down your power when in \u2011\nteracting with employees. One reason MBWA (man \u2011\nagement by walking around) is so effective is that \nit shifts the home field advantage to the staff\u2014the \nconversation happens on their territory, not yours. \nOf course, some conversations will need to hap \u2011\npen in your office, but you can take steps to make \nyour guests feel more comfortable. Add a small table \nwith chairs of the same size and quality so that when \nsomeone comes to talk, you can sit together. Table \nshape matters, too. It\u2019s usually easy to guess who has \nthe most power at an oval or a rectangular table, but \nthere\u2019s no \u201chead\u201d at a round table. And consider your \nattire: Do you really need a tie for meetings with the \ncreative team? You want employees to feel you\u2019re \none of them. \nKen Freeman, a successful corporate executive \nfor decades before becoming the dean of Boston \nUniversity\u2019s Questrom School of Business, is some \u2011\none who understands power signals. When he ar \u2011\nrived at the school, the dean\u2019s office was on a high \nfloor with limited access. It was larger and more \nluxurious than any corporate office he\u2019d ever had. \nHardly anyone came to see him. So he moved to a \nsmall office with a clear \u2011glass exterior wall, located \non a classroom floor just down the hall from a heavily \ntrafficked coffee shop. And he made another con \u2011\nscious choice to signal who he is and what he cares \nabout: The only awards he put on prominent display \nwere those for ethics and his academic diplomas.much you value their input. Then be sure to adopt at \nleast one idea or solve at least one problem that was \nmentioned, letting everyone know who deserves the \ncredit for bringing it up. \nBe transparent. Transparency about feedback \nprocesses can reduce anxiety and increase partici \u2011\npation. In one midsize health services company, a \nVP for quality outlined a six \u2011week plan for gathering \nand acting on employee ideas for improvements in \nthree major areas. She laid out three clear phases: \ntwo weeks to collect ideas through an online plat \u2011\nform; two weeks for task forces to evaluate the im \u2011\npact and feasibility of the ideas; and two weeks to \nprioritize which ideas would be implemented, cre \u2011\nate timelines, and announce plans to the rest of the \ncompany. Spelling out guidelines and commitments \nup front made contributing feel less daunting and \nfutile to employees.\nReach out. If you really want to know what peo \u2011\nple think about something, go ask them. Otherwise, \nemployees might seek you out only when things are \ngetting really bad for them. However, try not to shut \nout good suggestions that don\u2019t happen to jibe with \nyour current priorities. A VP of manufacturing in a \nhealth products company told us he\u2019d once saved \nabout a million dollars because, during a plant visit, \nhe\u2019d veered from the scheduled \u201cdog and pony show\u201d \nto walk the floor by himself and talk with frontline \nemployees. One of them mentioned a flaw in the de \u2011\nsign of some bubble wrap, which the VP jotted down \nand was able to quickly address. \nSoliciting feedback informally can be much more \neffective than just being open to it when it comes \nyour way. In our study of financial institutions, we \nfound that proactively reaching out to subordinates \nfor suggestions increased employees\u2019 willingness to \nspeak up twice as much as simply being open did. \nWhen you do ask for feedback, go to the people \nwho know something you don\u2019t.

And then bring them with you to \npre sent additional data that might convince higher \u2011\nups. This has a few benefits: First, it shows your \npeople that you were willing to make an effort on \ntheir behalf, something they\u2019re likely to appreci \u2011\nate no matter how things turn out.

And third, it keeps them in \u2011\nformed about your progress so that they aren\u2019t left \nwondering what\u2019s happened since they spoke with \nyou\u2014which brings us to our final recommendation. \nClose the loop. If you don\u2019t want people to \nthink their ideas went straight to the trash can, make \nsure you tell them what you did next and what they \ncan expect as a result. In surveys of more than 3,500 \nemployees in multiple companies, we found that \nbosses\u2019 failure to close the loop increased subordi \u2011\nnates\u2019 belief that speaking up was futile by 30%. But \nif managers had closed the loop in the past, their re \u2011\nports spoke up 19% more frequently\u2014even after we \naccounted for any increase that happened simply  \nbecause managers were perceived as open, inter \u2011\nested, and willing to make changes.\nEven the best \u2011intentioned leaders often fall \ndown on follow \u2011up just because they are busy \nfighting fires. So consider adopting processes that \nformally include next steps, such as the \u201cstrategic \nfitness process\u201d developed by Mike Beer and his \ncolleagues at the consulting firm TruePoint. It calls \nfor managers to receive input from a task force \nthat gathers employees\u2019 comments and highlights \nthemes. The managers then report to the task force \nwhat they will do in response to the feedback. Task \nforce members are responsible for communicat \u2011\ning plans to the staff and helping implement the \nchanges. Another effective tactic is simply to adhere \nto strict, well \u2011publicized timelines for collecting, \nevaluating, and implementing ideas.\nGETTING THE ideas you want and need from your em \u2011\nployees will always be a challenge. Most people care \ntoo much about their social and material well \u2011being \nto routinely speak truth to power\u2014unless you clear \nsome obstacles out of the way. Halfhearted efforts \nlike anonymous reporting systems and vague invita \u2011\ntions to submit ideas won\u2019t do the trick. What will \nmake a difference is taking steps to assure people \nthat it\u2019s both safe and worthwhile to contribute, no \nmatter where they sit in the organization.  \nHBR Reprint R1601FAvoid sending mixed messages. In one R&D \norganization, the managers were baffled that the \nbrilliant researchers they\u2019d recruited turned out \nto be uninspiring. But while the firm boasted that \nit hired only the best, it made its talent feel dumb. \nWhen researchers presented to senior managers, \nthey were routinely beaten up and their ideas shot \ndown. Challenging the status quo felt unsafe there. \nEven informal \u201cblue\u2011sky\u201d sessions were stifled by re \u2011\nminders to use the company\u2019s standard PowerPoint \ntemplate and adhere to rules about maximum words \nper slide, which reinforced the feeling that people \nneeded to stay within certain bounds.\nBe the example.  Most employees understand \nthat you don\u2019t have full control over the resources \nor decisions needed to address their issues. To de \u2011\ntermine whether it\u2019s worth bringing things to your \nattention, they calculate how likely you are to rep \u2011\nresent their interests to the leaders above you. To \ndocument this implicit calculus, we asked more than \n10,000 restaurant employees to what extent their \nshift supervisors took their problems and sugges \u2011\ntions to the general manager for action. Those whose \nbosses frequently acted on their behalf had signifi \u2011\ncantly reduced feelings of futility. What\u2019s more, they \nshared their concerns and ideas with their supervi \u2011\nsors 10% more frequently than employees whose \nbosses didn\u2019t represent them. \nEmployees feel inspired when they see you advo \u2011\ncating for them. That message came through quite \nclearly when we spoke with people at a real estate \nfirm. A team there had inherited a proj  ect that its \nmembers quickly realized would lead to a danger \u2011\nous and illegal situation if allowed to continue. One \nemployee described the group\u2019s leader as \u201ccoura \u2011\ngeous, \u201d explaining that he was \u201cunafraid to speak up \nand point out the issues involved.

LE GUIN \nWith a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of \nSummer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. The rigging of \nthe boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the streets between houses with \nred roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and under \navenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved. \nSome were decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey, grave \nmaster workmen, quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as \nthey walked. In other streets the music beat faster, a shimmering of gong \nand tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance. \nChildren dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing \nflights over the music and the singing. All the processions wound towards \nthe north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the Green \nFields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with mud-stained feet and \nankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race. \nThe horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. Their manes were \nbraided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils \nand pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, the horse \nbeing the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own. Far off \nto the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her \nbay. The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the \nEighteen Peaks burned with white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, \nunder the dark blue of the sky. There was just enough wind to make the \nbanners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. In the \nsilence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding \nthrough the city streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful \nfaint sweetness of the air that from time to time trembled and gathered \ntogether and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells. \nJoyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens \nof Omelas? \nThey were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. But we do \nnot say the words of cheer much any more. All smiles have become archaic. \nGiven a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. \nGiven a description such as this one tends to look next for the King, mounted \non a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a \ngolden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. But there was no king.

They were not barbarians. I do not know the \nrules and laws of their society, but I suspect that they were singularly few. As \nthey did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock \nexchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. Yet I repeat \nthat these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland \nUtopians. They were not less complex than us. The trouble is that we have a \nbad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happi \nness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interest \ning. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and \nthe terrible boredom of pain. If you can't lick 'em, join 'em. If it hurts, \nrepeat it. But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is \nto lose hold of everything else. We have almost lost hold; we can no longer \ndescribe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. How can I tell you \nabout the people of Omelas? They were not naive and happy children? \nthough their children were, in fact, happy. They were mature, intelligent, \npassionate adults whose lives were not wretched. O miracle! but I wish I \ncould describe it better. I wish I could convince you. Omelas sounds in my \nwords like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. \nPerhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming \nit will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all. For instance, \nhow about technology? I think that there would be no cars or helicopters in \nand above the streets; this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas \nare happy people. Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is \nnecessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. \nIn the middle category, however?that of the unnecessary but undestruc \ntive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.?they could perfectly well \nhave central heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of \nmarvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources, fuelless \npower, a cure for the common cold. Or they could have none of that: it \ndoesn't matter. As you like it. I incline to think that people from towns up \nand down the coast have been coming in to Omelas during the last days \nbefore the Festival on the very fast little trains and double-decked trams, \nand that the train station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in \ntown, though plainer than the magnificent Farmers' Market. But even \ngranted trains, I fear that Omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody. \nSmiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. If so, please add an orgy. If an orgy \nwould help, don't hesitate. Let us not, however, have temples from which \nissue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready \nto copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union \nwith the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. But \nreally it would be better not to have any temples in Omelas?at least, not \nmanned temples. Religion yes, clergy no. Surely the beautiful nudes can just \nwander about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the \nneedy and the rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. Let tam \nbourines be struck above the copulations, and the glory of desire be \nproclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) let the offspring \nThis content downloaded from 132.236.173.14 on Thu, 28 Aug 2014 15:49:03 PM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Omelas 3 \nof these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all. One thing I \nknow there is none of in Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be? I \nthought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. For those who \nlike it, the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the \ncity, drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance to the mind and \nlimbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions \nat last of the very arcana and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as \nexciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not habit-forming. For \nmore modest tastes I think there ought to be beer. What else, what else \nbelongs in the joyous city? The sense of victory, surely, the celebration of \ncourage. But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. The joy \nbuilt upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is \nfearful and it is trivial. A boundless and generous contentment, a magnani \nmous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the \nfinest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the \nworld's summer: this is what swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and \nthe victory they celebrate is that of life. I really don't think many of them \nneed to take drooz. \nMost of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now. A \nmarvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents of the \nprovisioners. The faces of small children are amiably sticky; in the benign \ngrey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled. The \nyouths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group \naround the starting line of the course. An old woman, small, fat, and laugh \ning, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men wear her \nflowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the \ncrowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute. People pause to listen, and they \nsmile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never \nsees them, his dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thin magic of the tune. \nHe finishes, and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute. \nAs if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet \nsounds from the pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, \npiercing. The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them neigh in \nanswer. Sober-faced, the young riders stroke the horses' necks and soothe \nthem, whispering, \"Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope. . . .\" They \nbegin to form in rank along the starting line. The crowds along the race \ncourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind. The Festival of \nSummer has begun. \nDo you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then \nlet me describe one more thing. \nIn a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or \nperhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private homes, there is a room. It \nhas one locked door, and no window. A little light seeps in dustily between \ncracks in the boards, secondhand from a cob webbed window somewhere \nacross the cellar. In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, \nclotted, foul-smelling heads, stand near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a \nThis content downloaded from 132.236.173.14 on Thu, 28 Aug 2014 15:49:03 PM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.4 UTOPIAN STUDIES \nlittle damp to the touch as cellar dirt usually is. The room is about three \npaces long and two wide: a mere broom closet or disused tool room. In the \nroom a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl. It looks about six, but \nactually is nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective, or \nperhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It \npicks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it \nsits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops. It is \nafraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the \nmops are still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. \nThe door is always locked; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes \n?the child has no understanding of time or interval?sometimes the door \nrattles terribly and opens, and a person, or several people, are there. One of \nthem may come in and kick the child to make it stand up. The others never \ncome close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. The food bowl \nand the water jug are hastily filled, the door is locked, the eyes disappear. \nThe people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always \nlived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice, \nsometimes speaks. \"I will be good,\" it says. \"Please let me out. I will be \ngood!\" They never answer. The child used to scream for help at night, and \ncry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining,4 'eh-haa, eh-haa,\" \nand it speaks less and less often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its \nbelly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day. It is \nnaked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its \nown excrement continually. \nThey all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have \ncome to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know \nthat it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but \nthey all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tender \nness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their \nscholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and \nthe kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable \nmisery. \nThis is usually explained to children when they are between eight and \ntwelve, whenever they seem capable of understanding; and most of those \nwho come to see the child are young people, though often enough an adult \ncomes, or comes back, to see the child. No matter how well the matter has \nbeen explained to them, these young spectators are always shocked and \nsickened at the sight. They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves \nsuperior to. They feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explana \ntions. They would like to do something for the child. But there is nothing \nthey can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile \nplace, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing, \nindeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty \nand delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed. Those are the terms. \nTo exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in Omelas for that \nsingle, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for \nThis content downloaded from 132.236.173.14 on Thu, 28 Aug 2014 15:49:03 PM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Omelas 5 \nthe chance of the happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls \nindeed. \nThe terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word \nspoken to the child. \nOften the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when \nthey have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox. They may brood \nover it for weeks or years. But as time goes on they begin to realize that even \nif the child could be released, it would not get much good of its freedom: a \nlittle vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little more. It is too \ndegraded and imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid too long ever \nto be free of fear. Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane \ntreatment. Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without \nwalls about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its own excrement \nto sit in. Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the \nterrible justice of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the \ntrying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are \nperhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid, \nirresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not free. \nThey know compassion. It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge \nof its existence, that makes possible the nobility of their architecture, the \npoignancy of their music, the profundity of their science. It is because of the \nchild that they are so gentle with children. They know that if the wretched \none were not there snivelling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, \ncould make no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the \nrace in the sunlight of the first morning of summer. \nNow do you believe in them? Are they not more credible? But there is \none more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible. \nAt times one of the adolescent girls or boys who goes to see the child \ndoes not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. Some \ntimes also a man or woman much older falls silent for a day or two, and then \nleaves home. These people go out into the street, and walk down the street \nalone. They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, \nthrough the beautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of \nOmelas. Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman. Night falls; the \ntraveler must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow-lit \nwindows, and on out into the darkness of the fields. Each alone, they go \nwest or north, towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they \nwalk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go \ntowards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happi \nness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they \nseem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas. \nCopyright ? 1973 by Ursula K. Le Guin; first appeared in New Dimensions 3.

All rights reserved.NOW AS NEVER BEFORE, MANAGERS are finding them-\nselves having to create effective cross-functional\nteams on the fly. New projects emerge that require a diver-sity of expertise not found within a single department;mergers and strategic partnerships thrust together newgroups of people for the first time. Whatever the founda-tion for their existence, each of these one-off teams shares a common trait: it mustbegin producing results right away.\nManaging a team that\u2019 s been created\nunder such circumstances presents a dis-tinct and ever more prevalent leadershipchallenge. It\u2019s hard enough to guide thedisparate mix of talent found in long-standing groups; when you are requiredto focus the efforts of people you may noteven know and who may not know oneanother\u2014and to do it immediately\u2014thechallenges are multiplied.\nIn striving to help managers address\nthese challenges, we have developed an approach calledrapid team building that is based on many years of organiz-\ning and leading interdisciplinary project teams, both asmanagers and as consultants. We have successfully appliedthis approach in a variety of organizational settings inwhich the need to achieve critical goals quickly and effec-tively with newly formed teams was essential. The approachcomprises six tools to help managers form a group ofemployees into a unified team andget them right down to work.\n1. Share personal background\ninformation\nAsking team members to share per-\nsonal histories by having each talk tothe group briefly about his work his-tory and experience can achieve twoimportant things: it conveys infor-mation about everyone\u2019s individualcompetencies, and it can generaterespect for those competencies within the group. It alsofosters cooperation by giving team members a sense ofshared history that serves as a substitute for the actualshared history experienced by members of long-standingteams.\nY ou can help the process along by asking open-ended,work-focused questions that allow team members to tell\ntheir own stories, such as: \u201cWould you tell us about thetypes of project teams in which you have participated?\u201d or\u201cTell us about some of the biggest challenges you\u2019ve facedon other teams and how you dealt with them. \u201d If you arealready acquainted with a particular team member, you\ncan tell that person\u2019s story as a way ofacknowledging prior acquaintance andprofessional reputation.\n2. Ask team members what\nworked for them in the past\nWhen you ask team members to discuss\nwhat has contributed to the success oftheir past teams, you are making use of apowerful tool for achieving both engage-ment and commitment.\nBy encouraging team members to\nshare their views, you signal respect fortheir competence and judgment. Y ou\nalso are likely to learn new and useful information frompeople who are both skilled and experienced.\nOne cautionary note: even as you encourage team\nmembers to share their ideas on how to be successful, youneed to make it clear that you are not inviting group deci-sion making. Without overtly accepting or rejecting anyone person\u2019s ideas, you can select from among all the ideasin formulating a plan of action. This demonstrates that you\nare open to the team\u2019s ideas, a coreelement in building the team\u2019sengagement with the assignment,while also signaling that you retainultimate responsibility for makingdecisions.\n3. Describe how the team will\nwork together\nTo rapidly engage the team in the\ntask at hand, you must impart aclear vision of the team\u2019s purpose\nand how team members will work together. This requiresmore than just giving out assignments.\nState clearly why the team has been formed; explain the\nproblem to be solved or the improvements that will result ifthe team is successful in its efforts. Then, articulate thedesired outcome of the team\u2019s efforts vividly and precisely.Building Effective Teams in Real Time\nby Jerry Garfield and Ken Stanton\nDescribe the deliverable \nin concrete terms, so that\neveryone understands\nwhat the final product\nwill look like.\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Building Effective Teams in Real Time (continued)\nIt\u2019s important to describe the deliverable in concrete terms\nso that everyone understands what the final product willlook like, whether it is a report or a \u201cgo live\u201d date for a newservice or product.\nNext, provide a detailed plan of\naction so that each team memberwill know exactly what must bedone and when. Give the due datesfor the deliverables and for the criti-cal tasks that must be accomplishedalong the way.\nFinally, you must make sure that\neach team member knows exactlyhow her role\u2014and the roles of oth-ers\u2014will contribute to achieving the team\u2019s goals.\n4. Optimize individual strengths\nOptimizing strengths means determining the best assign-ments for each member by taking account of individualteam member\u2019s experiences, training, and proven perform-\nance. The right assignments alig n team members\u2019 skills and\naptitudes with the team\u2019s goals, improving the likelihood ofsuccess in accomplishing the tasks at hand.\nAchieving this \u201cgoodness of fit\u201d\ndemonstrates that you were listeningwhen members shared their experi-ences and that you have engaged inwhatever other discussion was neces-sary to ensure that each member of theteam is in the job most well suited tohis skills. When you show this kind ofattention, it increases the likelihoodthat team members will respond in\nkind and that they will be willing to communicate openly asthe work progresses.\nFinally, care in making assignments demonstrates your\nintention to enable all team members to succeed in theirwork. To fully optimize the skills at your disposal, youmust be clear and precise about expected work outcomesfor each position on the team and for the team as a whole.\n5. Clarify how decisions will be made\nY ou can improve the effectiveness of your team by articu-lating how you approach decision making and deal withconflicts. Y ou should briefly outline the scope of decisionmaking for each position on the team, letting team mem-bers know that decisions affecting the functioning of theteam or its ability to achieve its mission should be broughtdirectly to you. For example, you should make all deci-sions that will affect the final outcome of the team\u2019s work,the overall timeline, or the work of other team members.\nConversely, you should refrain from interfering in deci-\nsions that appropriately should be made by individualteam members. Insisting that team members check withyou before prioritizing their daily activities or carrying outroutine tasks increases your own work and reduces theeffectiveness of the team as a whole. To the extent that theteam is made up of people with demonstrated experienceand competence, you should be able to limit your decisionsto those that affect the team and its mission as a whole.\n6. Ensure a free flow of information\nRapid team building requires information to be exchangedquickly, easily, and in all directions. Y ou need to establishclear processes for communicating within the team,including arrangements for written, electronic, or face-to-face communication for different aspects of the team\u2019swork.\nFor example, voicemail and e-mail may be useful for\nsome communications between individuals who have different schedules or who work in separate locations.Problem-solving discussions may require face-to-face or\n4harvard management update November 2005Rapid team building\nrequires information \nto be exchanged quickly,\neasily, and in all directions.\nTHE RAPID TEAM BUILDING TOOLKIT\nLeaders can build teams rapidly and effectively in real\ntime using the following six tools:\n1. Share personal histories\nPersonal stories reveal competencies, generaterespect, and foster cooperation.\n2. Ask: \u201cWhat has worked for you in the past?\u201d\nThis signals that past experiences are valued as poten-tial contributions.\n3. Describe how the team will work together\nClearly state the team\u2019s purpose and plan, and describeeach person\u2019s role within the team.\n4. Optimize individual team members\u2019\nstrengths \nMake realistic assignments that take advantage of\neach team member\u2019s individual strengths.\n5. Establish norms for making decisions \nLet team members know what types of decisions theyare expected to make on their own and what types ofdecisions will be made by the team leader. \n6. Establish a process for giving and receiving\nfeedback\nThis allows information to be exchanged quickly, eas-\nily, and in all directions.\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Building Effective Teams in Real Time (continued)\ntelephone interactions in real time\u2014although agreements\nand decisions should be documented. Informationrequired by the entire team, on the other hand, is bestshared in written form, whether on paper or electronically.\nThe most important aspect of team communication, and\nthe true test of effective communication, is the giving andreceiving of feedback. Give positive feedback frequentlyand enthusiastically, and identify the results achieved. Forexample, responding to suggestions by saying, \u201cGreat idea;that\u2019s a practical solution to our problem, \u201d or to completedtasks with, \u201cWell done; that\u2019s just what we needed, \u201d will helpmotivate team members to excel in their work.\nNegative feedback is essential for course correction and\nquality improvement, but it should be given without criti-cism or rancor. Saying, \u201cThat didn\u2019t work; what can I do tohelp you?\u201d or \u201cThis doesn\u2019t meet our needs; let me explainwhy, \u201d allows negative feedback to become an important\npart of the team\u2019s culture and ensures that critical informa-tion will not be hidden or minimized.\nY ou can establish a culture of effective communication\nby accepting negative feedback with gratitude, giving neg-ative feedback sparingly and without condemnation, andfinding opportunities to give positive feedback to everymember of the team. \n\u25c6\nJerry Garfield consults to executives and their teams \non matters of organization behavior, leadership, and \nchange management.

    "Desktop/Cornell/Leadership Skills/Chapter1TheArmyManual.pdf": " \n31 July 2019  ADP 6 -22 1-1 Chapter 1  \nThe Army  \nFor more than 240 years, the United States Army has protected the people and interests \nof the Nation. The Army is not alone. The Marines Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast \nGuard , government agencies, and local law enforcement and firefighters all perform \nsimilar services to the Nation and its communities. Al l volunteered. In many cases, \nthey choose to place themselves in harm \u2019s way based on a conviction that personal \nservice makes a difference. Leading Soldiers, though, requires a deeper understanding \nof what frames this profession and that all Soldiers come from different backgrounds \nand all possess distinct world -views. To inspire Soldiers to risk their lives requires \nprofessional leaders capable of providing purpose, direction, and motivation. This \nchapter describes the Army Profession and introduces Army l eadership.  \n\u2026the Soldier , above all other  people,  prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the \ndeepest wounds and scars of war.  \nGeneral  of the Army  Douglas MacArthur  \nThayer Award acceptance s peech, 1962  \nA SHARED LEGACY  \n1-1. War is a lethal clash of wills and  an inherently human endeavor that requires perseverance, sacrifice, \nand tenacity. The United States Army\u2019s primary reason for existence is to conduct lar ge-scale combat \noperations for as long as is required to prevail as part of the joint force. Army lead ers provide purpose, \ndirection, and motivation required to endure the physical hardship, privation, and danger of combat. Army \nleaders inspire others to risk their lives to accomplish missions of importance to the Nation.  All the other \ncontexts where leade rs exercise leadership daily ensure the Army is prepared to do what the Nation requires.  \n1-2. Army leaders have served honorably since the beginning of the Nation.  Americans fought the \nRevolutionary War to achieve an idea, that a group of different people could  find common ground and \ndemocratically govern themselves free from monarchs. Only a poet could summarize the meaning and \nenormity of this idea, the war, and its impact on the planet since then.  \nHere once the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard  round the world.  \nRalph Waldo Emerson  \nConcord Hymn  \n1-3. On 14 June 1775, the Continental Congress created the Continental Army and gave it the mission to \nfight Great Britain and help create what would become the United States of America. Those who believed in \na greater purpose and were willing to sacrifice for it made up this all -volunteer army, like today.  \n1-4. Following the Revolutionary War, the Nation had to resolve many new challenges. The Articles of the \nConfederation did not adequately allow for a central gove rning body , provide the capability to raise funds to \npay debt, or maintain a navy or army for defense. The colonies resolved to draft a constitution and provide a \nframework for a new form of government. In 1787, delegates from the colonies met in Philadelp hia and \ndrafted a constitution. For two years, the colonies debated; in 1789, they signed the Constitution of the United \nStates, forming the United States. In 1796, the Army officially became known as the United States Army.  \n1-5. Since 1796, the Army has change d many times. For most of its history , it was a small regular force \naugmented by militias and volunteers during times of crisis. It rapidly expanded to enormous size for a civil \nand two world wars, and then contracted again after the wars were won. The Arm y integrated in 1948. In \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Chapter 1  \n1-2 ADP 6 -22 31 July 2019  1973, the Nation determined that an all -volunteer professional force was a better idea than a conscripted \n(drafted) army.  In 201 6, all military occupation specialties opened to women and men alike. The United \nStates Army is likely to evolve again in the future, even as the purpose for i ts existence remains unchanged.  \n1-6. The Army of today carries the streamers of dozens of battles whose outcomes, in some cases, decided \nthe fate of this Nation and other countries. The Army\u2019s motto of \u201cTh is we\u2019ll d efend \u201d summarizes the Army\u2019s \nlegacy of responsibilit y. \nTHE ARMY PROFESSION  \n1-7. The Army Profession  is a vocation of Soldiers and D epartment of the Army Civilians whose collective \nexpertise is the ethical design of, support to, and application of land power; serving under civilian authority; \nand entrusted to defend the Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people . The Army \nProfession is unique because of its responsibilities related to the ethical application of violence on a large \nscale on behalf of the Nation. The Army Values guide the Army Profession.  \n1-8. Professions share essential characteristics. Professions \u2014 \n\uf06c Are a full -time occupation.  \n\uf06c Possess training or education programs relative to the field.  \n\uf06c Have a distinct body of knowledge.  \n\uf06c Operate within established ethics.  \n\uf06c Are self -policing.  \n1-9. Because of these generally accepted characteristics, society trusts professionals who possess the \ncharacter, commitment, and competence to be trusted. This trust grants professions the  autonomy and \ndiscretion with prudent, balanced oversight or external controls. If a profession violates its ethic and loses \nthe trust of society, then it becomes subject to increased societal regulation and governance.  \n1-10. The Army Values incorporate the historical Army Ethic:  loyalty, integrity, duty, and selfless -service . \nThey encompass the enduring moral principles, beliefs, and laws that shape the Army culture of trust and \nguide Army professionals in accomplishing the mission as well as  their conduct in all aspects of life . The \nArmy Ethic embodied within the Army Values has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and \ncultural traditions, and the historical legacy that frame our Nation. Army professionals take an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution, an obligation that includes adherence to United States Code, the Uniformed \nCode of Military Justice, and all applicable orders and directives. This includes respecting life and liberty as \nself-evident, universal rights.  \n1-11. The Army Values are \u2014 \n\uf06c Loyalty: bear tru e faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States , the Army, your \nunit and other Soldiers . \n\uf06c Duty: fulfill your obligations.  \n\uf06c Respect: treat people as they should be treated.  \n\uf06c Selfless service: put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and your su bordinates before your own.  \n\uf06c Honor: live up to the Army Values.  \n\uf06c Integrity: do what is right, legally and morally.  \n\uf06c Personal courage: face fear, danger, or adversity.  \n1-12. All members aspire to achieve the Army Values professionally and personally. The Army Values  are \na compass needle, always pointing toward  what the Nation demands of its Army. Often, the Army is the face \nof the Nation abroad. During conflict, the Army employs lethal violence in accordance with the law of armed \nconflict and rules of engagement unde r the most demanding conditions. This is an enormous responsibility \nand the people of the United States require the Army to adhere to its values and represent its interests across \nthe range of military operations and the competition continuum . See chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of the \nArmy Values.  \n1-13. The Constitution of the United States best illustrates the impacts of an army losing the trust of its \npeople. In the 18 th century, nations used standing armies  to subjugate people at the whim of the monarch. In \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.The Army  \n31 July 2019  ADP 6 -22 1-3 many ways, an army was the face of tyranny. Within the Constitution, there are certain controls that arose \nfrom the natural fear at the time of a standing army. Amendments in the Bill of Rights directly address \npractices of standing arm ies that  citizens  feared, such as unreasonable searches and seizures and the \nquartering of soldiers in private homes.  While these may seem dated and irrelevant today, they are not. They \nare steadfast reminders that the Army serves the people of the United States. The oaths  taken by enlisted and \ncommissioned Soldiers and DA Civilians  amplify these points . \nArmy Oaths  \nOath of Enlistment  \nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States against all enemies, foreign and domestic ; that I will bear true faith and \nallegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United \nStates and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.  \n \nOath of O ffice for commissioned officers and DA Civilians  \nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and \nallegiance to th e same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation \nor purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office \non which I am about to enter. So help me God.  \nARMY LEADERSHIP  \n1-14. The Army experience over more than two centuries is that most people have leadership potential  and \ncan learn to be effective leaders. The ability to influence others is a central component of leadership.

Along the way he helped \nto transform seven industries: personal computing, \nanimated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, \nretail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs \nin the pantheon of America\u2019s great innovators, along \nwith Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. \nNone of these men was a saint, but long after their \npersonalities are forgotten, history will remember \nhow they applied imagination to technology and \nbusiness. \nIn the months since my biography of Jobs came \nout, countless commentators have tried to draw \nmanagement lessons from it. Some of those readers \nhave been insightful, but I think that many of them \n(especially those with no experience in entrepreneur-\nship) fixate too much on the rough edges of his per-\nsonality. The essence of Jobs, I think, is that his per-\nsonality was integral to his way of doing business. He \nacted as if the normal rules didn\u2019t apply to him, and \nthe passion, intensity, and extreme emotionalism he \nbrought to everyday life were things he also poured \ninto the products he made. His petulance and impa-\ntience were part and parcel of his perfectionism.\nOne of the last times I saw him, after I had finished \nwriting most of the book, I asked him again about his \ntendency to be rough on people. \u201cLook at the re-\nsults, \u201d he replied. \u201cThese are all smart people I work \nwith, and any of them could get a top job at another \nplace if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they \ndon\u2019t. \u201d Then he paused for a few moments and said, \nalmost wistfully, \u201cAnd we got some amazing things \ndone. \u201d Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits \nover the past dozen years that was greater than that \nof any other innovative company in modern times: \niMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, \nMacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion\u2014not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final \nillness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal \ncadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for \nyears and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.\nSo I think the real lessons from Steve Jobs have \nto be drawn from looking at what he actually accom-\nplished. I once asked him what he thought was his \nmost important creation, thinking he would answer \nthe iPad or the Macintosh. Instead he said it was Ap-\nple the company. Making an enduring company, he \nsaid, was both far harder and more important than \nmaking a great product. How did he do it? Business \nschools will be studying that question a century \nfrom now. Here are what I consider the keys to his \nsuccess.\nFocus\nWhen Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was produc-\ning a random array of computers and peripherals, \nincluding a dozen different versions of the Macin-\ntosh. After a few weeks of product review sessions, \nhe\u2019d finally had enough. \u201cStop!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThis \nis crazy. \u201d He grabbed a Magic Marker, padded in his \nbare feet to a whiteboard, and drew a two-by-two \ngrid. \u201cHere\u2019s what we need, \u201d he declared. Atop the \ntwo columns, he wrote \u201cConsumer\u201d and \u201cPro. \u201d He \nlabeled the two rows \u201cDesktop\u201d and \u201cPortable. \u201d \nTheir job, he told his team members, was to focus on \nfour great products, one for each quadrant. All other \nproducts should be canceled. There was a stunned \nsilence. But by getting Apple to focus on making just \nfour computers, he saved the company. \u201cDeciding \nwhat not to do is as important as deciding what to \ndo, \u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s true for companies, and it\u2019s \ntrue for products. \u201d \nAfter he righted the company, Jobs began taking \nhis \u201ctop 100\u201d people on a retreat each year. On the \nlast day, he would stand in front of a whiteboard (he \u201c The people who are crazy enough to think they \ncan change the world are the ones who do.\u201d\n \u2014Apple\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d commercial, 1997\n4 \u2002Harvard Business r eview\u2002April 2012\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.loved whiteboards, because they gave him complete \ncontrol of a situation and they engendered focus) \nand ask, \u201cWhat are the 10 things we should be doing \nnext?\u201d People would fight to get their suggestions on \nthe list. Jobs would write them down\u2014and then cross \noff the ones he decreed dumb. After much jockeying, \nthe group would come up with a list of 10. Then Jobs \nwould slash the bottom seven and announce, \u201cWe \ncan only do three. \u201d\nFocus was ingrained in Jobs\u2019s personality and \nhad been honed by his Zen training. He relentlessly \nfiltered out what he considered distractions. Col-\nleagues and family members would at times be exas-\nperated as they tried to get him to deal with issues\u2014a \nlegal problem, a medical diagnosis\u2014they considered \nimportant. But he would give a cold stare and refuse \nto shift his laserlike focus until he was ready. \nNear the end of his life, Jobs was visited at home \nby Larry Page, who was about to resume control \nof Google, the company he had cofounded. Even \nthough their companies were feuding, Jobs was will-\ning to give some advice. \u201cThe main thing I stressed \nwas focus, \u201d he recalled. Figure out what Google \nwants to be when it grows up, he told Page. \u201cIt\u2019s \nnow all over the map. What are the five products \nyou want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because \nthey\u2019re dragging you down. They\u2019re turning you into \nMicrosoft. They\u2019re causing you to turn out products \nthat are adequate but not great. \u201d Page followed the \nadvice. In January 2012 he told employees to focus \non just a few priorities, such as Android and Google+, \nand to make them \u201cbeautiful, \u201d the way Jobs would \nhave done.\nSimplify\nJobs\u2019s Zenlike ability to focus was accompanied by \nthe related instinct to simplify things by zeroing in \non their essence and eliminating unnecessary com -\nponents. \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication, \u201d \ndeclared Apple\u2019s first marketing brochure. To see \nwhat that means, compare any Apple software with, \nsay, Microsoft Word, which keeps getting uglier and \nmore cluttered with nonintuitive navigational rib-\nbons and intrusive features. It is a reminder of the \nglory of Apple\u2019s quest for simplicity.\nJobs learned to admire simplicity when he was \nworking the night shift at Atari as a college dropout. \nAtari\u2019s games came with no manual and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman \ncould figure them out. The only instructions for its \nStar Trek game were: \u201c1. Insert quarter. 2. Avoid Klin-\ngons. \u201d His love of simplicity in design was refined at \ndesign conferences he attended at the Aspen Insti-\ntute in the late 1970s on a campus built in the Bau-\nhaus style, which emphasized clean lines and func-\ntional design devoid of frills or distractions. \nWhen Jobs visited Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research \nCenter and saw the plans for a computer that had a \ngraphical user interface and a mouse, he set about \nmaking the design both more intuitive (his team en-\nabled the user to drag and drop documents and fold-\ners on a virtual desktop) and simpler. For example, \nthe Xerox mouse had three buttons and cost $300; \nJobs went to a local industrial design firm and told \none of its founders, Dean Hovey, that he wanted a \nsimple, single-button model that cost $15. Hovey \ncomplied. \nJobs aimed for the simplicity that comes from \nconquering, rather than merely ignoring, complex -\nity. Achieving this depth of simplicity, he realized, \nwould produce a machine that felt as if it deferred \nto users in a friendly way, rather than challenging them. \u201cIt takes a lot of hard work, \u201d he said, \u201cto make \nsomething simple, to truly understand the underly -\ning challenges and come up with elegant solutions. \u201d \nIn Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s industrial designer, Jobs met \nhis soul mate in the quest for deep rather than su-\nperficial simplicity. They knew that simplicity is not \nmerely a minimalist style or the removal of clutter. In \norder to eliminate screws, buttons, or excess naviga-\ntional screens, it was necessary to understand pro -\nfoundly the role each element played. \u201cTo be truly \nsimple, you have to go really deep, \u201d Ive explained. \n\u201cFor example, to have no screws on something, you \ncan end up having a product that is so convoluted \nand so complex. The better way is to go deeper with \nthe simplicity, to understand everything about it and \nhow it\u2019s manufactured. \u201d \nDuring the design of the iPod interface, Jobs tried \nat every meeting to find ways to cut clutter. He in-\nsisted on being able to get to whatever he wanted \nin three clicks. One navigation screen, for example, \nasked users whether they wanted to search by song, album, or artist. \u201cWhy do we need that screen?\u201d \nJobs demanded. The designers realized they didn\u2019t. \n\u201cThere would be times when we\u2019d rack our brains \non a user interface problem, and he would go, \u2018Did \nyou think of this?\u2019\u201d says Tony Fadell, who led the \niPod team. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d all go, \u2018Holy shit. \u2019 He\u2019d  \nApril 2012\u2002Harvard Business r eview\u20025For artIcle reprInts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or vIsIt hbr.

At first the team members were taken aback, \nbut then they realized the button was unnecessary. \nThe device would gradually power down if it wasn\u2019t \nbeing used and would spring to life when reengaged.\nLikewise, when Jobs was shown a cluttered set \nof proposed navigation screens for iDVD, which al-\nlowed users to burn video onto a disk, he jumped up \nand drew a simple rectangle on a whiteboard. \u201cHere\u2019s \nthe new application, \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got one window. \nYou drag your video into the window. Then you click \nthe button that says \u2018Burn. \u2019 That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what \nwe\u2019re going to make. \u201d \nIn looking for industries or categories ripe for dis-\nruption, Jobs always asked who was making prod-\nucts more complicated than they should be. In 2001 \nportable music players and ways to acquire songs on-\nline fit that description, leading to the iPod and the \niTunes Store. Mobile phones were next. Jobs would \ngrab a phone at a meeting and rant (correctly) that no -\nbody could possibly figure out how to navigate half \nthe features, including the address book. At the end \nof his career he was setting his sights on the televi-\nsion industry, which had made it almost impossible \nfor people to click on a simple device to watch what \nthey wanted when they wanted.\nTake Responsibility \nEnd to End\nJobs knew that the best way to achieve simplic-\nity was to make sure that hardware, software, and \nperipheral devices were seamlessly integrated. An \nApple ecosystem\u2014an iPod connected to a Mac with \niTunes software, for example\u2014allowed devices to be \nsimpler, syncing to be smoother, and glitches to be \nrarer. The more complex tasks, such as making new \nplaylists, could be done on the computer, allowing \nthe iPod to have fewer functions and buttons.\nJobs and Apple took end-to-end responsibility for \nthe user experience\u2014something too few companies \ndo. From the performance of the ARM microproces-\nsor in the iPhone to the act of buying that phone in an \nApple Store, every aspect of the customer experience \nwas tightly linked together. Both Microsoft in the \n1980s and Google in the past few years have taken a \nmore open approach that allows their operating sys-\ntems and software to be used by various hardware manufacturers. That has sometimes proved the bet -\nter business model. But Jobs fervently believed that \nit was a recipe for (to use his technical term) crappier \nproducts. \u201cPeople are busy, \u201d he said. \u201cThey have \nother things to do than think about how to integrate \ntheir computers and devices. \u201d \nPart of Jobs\u2019s compulsion to take responsibil-\nity for what he called \u201cthe whole widget\u201d stemmed \nfrom his personality, which was very controlling. But \nit was also driven by his passion for perfection and \nmaking elegant products. He got hives, or worse, \nwhen contemplating the use of great Apple software \non another company\u2019s uninspired hardware, and he \nwas equally allergic to the thought that unapproved \napps or content might pollute the perfection of an \nApple device. It was an approach that did not always \nmaximize short-term profits, but in a world filled \nwith junky devices, inscrutable error messages, and \nannoying interfaces, it led to astonishing products \nmarked by delightful user experiences. Being in the \nApple ecosystem could be as sublime as walking in \none of the Zen gardens of Kyoto that Jobs loved, and \nneither experience was created by worshipping at \nthe altar of openness or by letting a thousand flow -\ners bloom. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to be in the hands of \na control freak. \nWhen Behind,  \nLeapfrog\nThe mark of an innovative company is not only that \nit comes up with new ideas first. It also knows how \nto leapfrog when it finds itself behind. That hap-\npened when Jobs built the original iMac. He focused \non making it useful for managing a user\u2019s photos and \nvideos, but it was left behind when dealing with mu-\nsic. People with PCs were downloading and swapping \nmusic and then ripping and burning their own CDs. \nThe iMac\u2019s slot drive couldn\u2019t burn CDs. \u201cI felt like a \ndope, \u201d he said. \u201cI thought we had missed it. \u201d\nBut instead of merely catching up by upgrading \nthe iMac\u2019s CD drive, he decided to create an inte-\ngrated system that would transform the music in -\ndustry. The result was the combination of iTunes, the \niTunes Store, and the iPod, which allowed users to \nbuy, share, manage, store, and play music better than \nthey could with any other devices. \nAfter the iPod became a huge success, Jobs spent \nlittle time relishing it. Instead he began to worry \nabout what might endanger it. One possibility was Being in the Apple \necosystem could be as sublime as walking in one of \nthe Zen gardens  \nof Kyoto that  \nJobs loved.\n6 \u2002Harvard Business r eview\u2002April 2012\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.that mobile phone makers would start adding music \nplayers to their handsets. So he cannibalized iPod \nsales by creating the iPhone. \u201cIf we don\u2019t cannibal-\nize ourselves, someone else will, \u201d he said.\nPut Products  \nBefore Profits\nWhen Jobs and his small team designed the original \nMacintosh, in the early 1980s, his injunction was to \nmake it \u201cinsanely great. \u201d He never spoke of profit \nmaximization or cost trade-offs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about \nprice, just specify the computer\u2019s abilities, \u201d he told \nthe original team leader. At his first retreat with the \nMacintosh team, he began by writing a maxim on \nhis whiteboard: \u201cDon\u2019t compromise. \u201d The machine \nthat resulted cost too much and led to Jobs\u2019s ouster \nfrom Apple. But the Macintosh also \u201cput a dent in \nthe universe, \u201d as he said, by accelerating the home \ncomputer revolution. And in the long run he got the \nbalance right: Focus on making the product great \nand the profits will follow.\nJohn Sculley, who ran Apple from 1983 to 1993, \nwas a marketing and sales executive from Pepsi. \nHe focused more on profit maximization than on \nproduct design after Jobs left, and Apple gradually \ndeclined. \u201cI have my own theory about why decline \nhappens at companies, \u201d Jobs told me: They make \nsome great products, but then the sales and market -\ning people take over the company, because they are \nthe ones who can juice up profits. \u201cWhen the sales \nguys run the company, the product guys don\u2019t mat -\nter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It hap-\npened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was \nmy fault, and it happened when Ballmer took over \nat Microsoft. \u201d\nWhen Jobs returned, he shifted Apple\u2019s focus \nback to making innovative products: the sprightly \niMac, the PowerBook, and then the iPod, the iPhone, \nand the iPad. As he explained, \u201cMy passion has been \nto build an enduring company where people were \nmotivated to make great products. Everything else \nwas secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit, \nbecause that was what allowed you to make great \nproducts. But the products, not the profits, were the \nmotivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where \nthe goal was to make money. It\u2019s a subtle difference, \nbut it ends up meaning everything\u2014the people \nyou hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in \nmeetings. \u201dDon\u2019t Be a Slave  \nTo Focus Groups\nWhen Jobs took his original Macintosh team on its \nfirst retreat, one member asked whether they should \ndo some market research to see what customers \nwanted. \u201cNo, \u201d Jobs replied, \u201cbecause customers \ndon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them. \u201d \nHe invoked Henry Ford\u2019s line \u201cIf I\u2019d asked customers \nwhat they wanted, they would have told me, \u2018A faster \nhorse!\u2019\u201d \nCaring deeply about what customers want is \nmuch different from continually asking them what \nthey want; it requires intuition and instinct about \ndesires that have not yet formed. \u201cOur task is to read \nthings that are not yet on the page, \u201d Jobs explained. \nInstead of relying on market research, he honed his \nversion of empathy\u2014an intimate intuition about \nthe desires of his customers. He developed his ap-\npreciation for intuition\u2014feelings that are based on \naccumulated experiential wisdom\u2014while he was \nstudying Buddhism in India as a college dropout. \n\u201cThe people in the Indian countryside don\u2019t use their \nintellect like we do; they use their intuition instead, \u201d \nhe recalled. \u201cIntuition is a very powerful thing\u2014\nmore powerful than intellect, in my opinion. \u201d\nSometimes that meant that Jobs used a one-\nperson focus group: himself. He made products that \nhe and his friends wanted. For example, there were many portable music players around in 2000, but \nJobs felt they were all lame, and as a music fanatic \nhe wanted a simple device that would allow him to \ncarry a thousand songs in his pocket. \u201cWe made the \niPod for ourselves, \u201d he said, \u201cand when you\u2019re doing \nsomething for yourself, or your best friend or family, \nyou\u2019re not going to cheese out. \u201d\nBend Reality\nJobs\u2019s (in)famous ability to push people to do the im-\npossible was dubbed by colleagues his Reality Dis-\ntortion Field, after an episode of Star Trek  in which \naliens create a convincing alternative reality through \nsheer mental force. An early example was when \nJobs was on the night shift at Atari and pushed Steve \nWozniak to create a game called Breakout. Woz said \nit would take months, but Jobs stared at him and in-\nsisted he could do it in four days. Woz knew that was \nimpossible, but he ended up doing it. \nApril 2012\u2002Harvard Business r eview\u20027For artIcle reprInts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or vIsIt hbr.

But those who worked with him admitted \nthat the trait, infuriating as it might be, led them to \nperform extraordinary feats. Because Jobs felt that \nlife\u2019s ordinary rules didn\u2019t apply to him, he could in-\nspire his team to change the course of computer his-\ntory with a small fraction of the resources that Xerox \nor IBM had. \u201cIt was a self-fulfilling distortion, \u201d recalls \nDebi Coleman, a member of the original Mac team \nwho won an award one year for being the employee \nwho best stood up to Jobs. \u201cYou did the impossible \nbecause you didn\u2019t realize it was impossible. \u201d \nOne day Jobs marched into the cubicle of Larry \nKenyon, the engineer who was working on the Ma-\ncintosh operating system, and complained that it \nwas taking too long to boot up. Kenyon started to ex -\nplain why reducing the boot-up time wasn\u2019t possible, \nbut Jobs cut him off. \u201cIf it would save a person\u2019s life, \ncould you find a way to shave 10 seconds off the boot \ntime?\u201d he asked. Kenyon allowed that he probably \ncould. Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that \nif five million people were using the Mac and it took \n10 seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added \nup to 300 million or so hours a year\u2014the equivalent \nof at least 100 lifetimes a year. After a few weeks  \nKenyon had the machine booting up 28 seconds \nfaster.\nWhen Jobs was designing the iPhone, he decided \nthat he wanted its face to be a tough, scratchproof \nglass, rather than plastic. He met with Wendell \nWeeks, the CEO of Corning, who told him that Corn-\ning had developed a chemical exchange process in \nthe 1960s that led to what it dubbed \u201cGorilla glass. \u201d \nJobs replied that he wanted a major shipment of Go -\nrilla glass in six months. Weeks said that Corning was not making the glass and didn\u2019t have that capacity. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, \u201d Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, \nwho was unfamiliar with Jobs\u2019s Reality Distortion \nField. He tried to explain that a false sense of confi-\ndence would not overcome engineering challenges, \nbut Jobs had repeatedly shown that he didn\u2019t accept \nthat premise. He stared unblinking at Weeks. \u201cYes, \nyou can do it, \u201d he said. \u201cGet your mind around it. You \ncan do it. \u201d Weeks recalls that he shook his head in \nastonishment and then called the managers of Corn-\ning\u2019s facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, which had \nbeen making LCD displays, and told them to convert \nimmediately to making Gorilla glass full-time. \u201cWe \ndid it in under six months, \u201d he says. \u201cWe put our best \nscientists and engineers on it, and we just made it work. \u201d As a result, every piece of glass on an iPhone \nor an iPad is made in America by Corning.\nImpute\nJobs\u2019s early mentor Mike Markkula wrote him a \nmemo in 1979 that urged three principles. The first \ntwo were \u201cempathy\u201d and \u201cfocus. \u201d The third was \nan awkward word, \u201cimpute, \u201d but it became one of \nJobs\u2019s key doctrines. He knew that people form an \nopinion about a product or a company on the basis of \nhow it is presented and packaged. \u201cMike taught me \nthat people do judge a book by its cover, \u201d he told me.\nWhen he was getting ready to ship the Macintosh \nin 1984, he obsessed over the colors and design of \nthe box. Similarly, he personally spent time design -\ning and redesigning the jewellike boxes that cradle \nthe iPod and the iPhone and listed himself on the \npatents for them. He and Ive believed that unpack -\ning was a ritual like theater and heralded the glory of \nthe product. \u201cWhen you open the box of an iPhone \nor iPad, we want that tactile experience to set the \ntone for how you perceive the product, \u201d Jobs said.\nSometimes Jobs used the design of a machine \nto \u201cimpute\u201d a signal rather than to be merely func -\ntional. For example, when he was creating the new \nand playful iMac, after his return to Apple, he was \nshown a design by Ive that had a little recessed han-\ndle nestled in the top. It was more semiotic than use-\nful. This was a desktop computer. Not many people \nwere really going to carry it around. But Jobs and Ive \nrealized that a lot of people were still intimidated \nby computers. If it had a handle, the new machine \nwould seem friendly, deferential, and at one\u2019s ser-\nvice. The handle signaled permission to touch the \niMac. The manufacturing team was opposed to the \nextra cost, but Jobs simply announced, \u201cNo, we\u2019re \ndoing this. \u201d He didn\u2019t even try to explain.\nPush for  \nPerfection \nDuring the development of almost every product he \never created, Jobs at a certain point \u201chit the pause \nbutton\u201d and went back to the drawing board because \nhe felt it wasn\u2019t perfect. That happened even with \nthe movie Toy Story. After Jeff Katzenberg and the team at Disney, which had bought the rights to the Jobs\u2019s (in)famous \nability to push people to do the impossible \nwas dubbed by \ncolleagues his Reality Distortion Field, after an episode of Star  \nTrek.\n8 \u2002Harvard Business r eview\u2002April 2012\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.movie, pushed the Pixar team to make it edgier and \ndarker, Jobs and the director, John Lasseter, finally \nstopped production and rewrote the story to make \nit friendlier. When he was about to launch Apple \nStores, he and his store guru, Ron Johnson, suddenly \ndecided to delay everything a few months so that the \nstores\u2019 layouts could be reorganized around activi-\nties and not just product categories. \nThe same was true for the iPhone. The initial de -\nsign had the glass screen set into an aluminum case. \nOne Monday morning Jobs went over to see Ive. \u201cI \ndidn\u2019t sleep last night, \u201d he said, \u201cbecause I realized \nthat I just don\u2019t love it. \u201d Ive, to his dismay, instantly \nsaw that Jobs was right. \u201cI remember feeling abso -\nlutely embarrassed that he had to make the obser-\nvation, \u201d he says. The problem was that the iPhone \nshould have been all about the display, but in its cur-\nrent design the case competed with the display in-\nstead of getting out of the way. The whole device felt \ntoo masculine, task-driven, efficient. \u201cGuys, you\u2019ve \nkilled yourselves over this design for the last nine \nmonths, but we\u2019re going to change it, \u201d Jobs told Ive\u2019s \nteam. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to work nights and \nweekends, and if you want, we can hand out some \nguns so you can kill us now. \u201d Instead of balking, the \nteam agreed. \u201cIt was one of my proudest moments at \nApple, \u201d Jobs recalled.\nA similar thing happened as Jobs and Ive were \nfinishing the iPad. At one point Jobs looked at the \nmodel and felt slightly dissatisfied. It didn\u2019t seem \ncasual and friendly enough to scoop up and whisk \naway. They needed to signal that you could grab it \nwith one hand, on impulse. They decided that the \nbottom edge should be slightly rounded, so that \na user would feel comfortable just snatching it up \nrather than lifting it carefully. That meant engineer-\ning had to design the necessary connection ports and \nbuttons in a thin, simple lip that sloped away gen-\ntly underneath. Jobs delayed the product until the \nchange could be made.\nJobs\u2019s perfectionism extended even to the parts \nunseen. As a young boy, he had helped his father \nbuild a fence around their backyard, and he was \ntold they had to use just as much care on the back of the fence as on the front. \u201cNobody will ever know, \u201d \nSteve said. His father replied, \u201cBut you will know. \u201d A \ntrue craftsman uses a good piece of wood even for \nthe back of a cabinet against the wall, his father ex -\nplained, and they should do the same for the back of \nthe fence. It was the mark of an artist to have such a \npassion for perfection. In overseeing the Apple II and the Macintosh, Jobs applied this lesson to the circuit \nboard inside the machine. In both instances he sent \nthe engineers back to make the chips line up neatly \nso the board would look nice. This seemed particu-\nlarly odd to the engineers of the Macintosh, because \nJobs had decreed that the machine be tightly sealed. \n\u201cNobody is going to see the PC board, \u201d one of them \nprotested. Jobs reacted as his father had: \u201cI want it to \nbe as beautiful as possible, even if it\u2019s inside the box. \nA great carpenter isn\u2019t going to use lousy wood for \nthe back of a cabinet, even though nobody\u2019s going \nto see it. \u201d They were true artists, he said, and should \nact that way. And once the board was redesigned, he \nhad the engineers and other members of the Macin-\ntosh team sign their names so that they could be en-\ngraved inside the case. \u201cReal artists sign their work, \u201d \nhe said. \n  Tolerate Only  \n\u201cA\u201d Players\nJobs was famously impatient, petulant, and tough \nwith the people around him. But his treatment of \npeople, though not laudable, emanated from his passion for perfection and his desire to work with \nonly the best. It was his way of preventing what he called \u201cthe bozo explosion, \u201d in which managers \nare so polite that mediocre people feel comfort -\nable sticking around. \u201cI don\u2019t think I run roughshod \nover people, \u201d he said, \u201cbut if something sucks, I tell \npeople to their face. It\u2019s my job to be honest. \u201d When \nI pressed him on whether he could have gotten the \nsame results while being nicer, he said perhaps \nso. \u201cBut it\u2019s not who I am, \u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s \na better way\u2014a gentlemen\u2019s club where we all wear \nties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet \ncode words\u2014but I don\u2019t know that way, because I am  \nmiddle-class from California. \u201d\nWas all his stormy and abusive behavior neces-\nsary? Probably not. There were other ways he could \nhave motivated his team. \u201cSteve\u2019s contributions \ncould have been made without so many stories about \nhim terrorizing folks, \u201d Apple\u2019s cofounder, Wozniak, \nsaid. \u201cI like being more patient and not having so \nmany conflicts. I think a company can be a good fam-\nily. \u201d But then he added something that is undeniably \ntrue: \u201cIf the Macintosh project had been run my way, things probably would have been a mess. \u201d\nIt\u2019s important to appreciate that Jobs\u2019s rudeness \nand roughness were accompanied by an ability to \nApril 2012\u2002Harvard Business r eview\u20029For artIcle reprInts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or vIsIt hbr.

He infused Apple employees with \nan abiding passion to create groundbreaking prod-\nucts and a belief that they could accomplish what \nseemed impossible. And we have to judge him \nby the outcome. Jobs had a close-knit family, and \nso it was at Apple: His top players tended to stick \naround longer and be more loyal than those at other \ncompanies, including ones led by bosses who were \nkinder and gentler. CEOs who study Jobs and de-\ncide to emulate his roughness without understand-\ning his ability to generate loyalty make a dangerous \nmistake. \n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that when you have \nreally good people, you don\u2019t have to baby them, \u201d \nJobs told me. \u201cBy expecting them to do great things, \nyou can get them to do great things. Ask any mem-\nber of that Mac team. They will tell you it was worth \nthe pain. \u201d Most of them do. \u201cHe would shout at a \nmeeting, \u2018You asshole, you never do anything right, \u2019\u201d \nDebi Coleman recalls. \u201cYet I consider myself the ab-\nsolute luckiest person in the world to have worked \nwith him. \u201d\nEngage  \nFace-to-Face\nDespite being a denizen of the digital world, or \nmaybe because he knew all too well its potential \nto be isolating, Jobs was a strong believer in face-\nto-face meetings. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation in our \nnetworked age to think that ideas can be developed \nby e-mail and iChat, \u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Cre-\nativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from \nrandom discussions. You run into someone, you ask \nwhat they\u2019re doing, you say \u2018Wow, \u2019 and soon you\u2019re \ncooking up all sorts of ideas. \u201d \nHe had the Pixar building designed to promote \nunplanned encounters and collaborations. \u201cIf a \nbuilding doesn\u2019t encourage that, you\u2019ll lose a lot \nof innovation and the magic that\u2019s sparked by ser-\nendipity, \u201d he said. \u201cSo we designed the building to \nmake people get out of their offices and mingle in the \ncentral atrium with people they might not otherwise \nsee. \u201d The front doors and main stairs and corridors \nall led to the atrium; the caf\u00e9 and the mailboxes \nwere there; the conference rooms had windows that \nlooked out onto it; and the 600-seat theater and two \nsmaller screening rooms all spilled into it. \u201cSteve\u2019s \ntheory worked from day one, \u201d Lasseter recalls. \u201cI \nkept running into people I hadn\u2019t seen for months. I\u2019ve never seen a building that promoted collabora-\ntion and creativity as well as this one. \u201d\nJobs hated formal presentations, but he loved \nfreewheeling face-to-face meetings. He gathered \nhis executive team every week to kick around \nideas without a formal agenda, and he spent ev -\nery Wednesday afternoon doing the same with his \nmarketing and advertising team. Slide shows were \nbanned. \u201cI hate the way people use slide presenta-\ntions instead of thinking, \u201d Jobs recalled. \u201cPeople \nwould confront a problem by creating a presenta-\ntion. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People \nwho know what they\u2019re talking about don\u2019t need \nPowerPoint. \u201d\nKnow Both the  \nBig Picture and  \nThe Details\nJobs\u2019s passion was applied to issues both large and \nminuscule. Some CEOs are great at vision; others are managers who know that God is in the details. Jobs \nwas both. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes says that \none of Jobs\u2019s salient traits was his ability and desire \nto envision overarching strategy while also focusing \non the tiniest aspects of design. For example, in 2000 \nhe came up with the grand vision that the personal \ncomputer should become a \u201cdigital hub\u201d for manag-\ning all of a user\u2019s music, videos, photos, and content, \nand thus got Apple into the personal-device business \nwith the iPod and then the iPad. In 2010 he came up with the successor strategy\u2014the \u201chub\u201d would move \nto the cloud\u2014and Apple began building a huge \nserver farm so that all a user\u2019s content could be up-\nloaded and then seamlessly synced to other personal \ndevices. But even as he was laying out these grand \nvisions, he was fretting over the shape and color of \nthe screws inside the iMac. \nCombine the  \nHumanities with \nThe Sciences\n\u201cI always thought of myself as a humanities person \nas a kid, but I liked electronics, \u201d Jobs told me on the \nday he decided to cooperate on a biography. \u201cThen I \nread something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land \nof Polaroid, said about the importance of people who \n150\n100\n10 \u2002Harvard Business r eview\u2002April 2012For artIcle reprInts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or vIsIt hbr.

There \nwere greater technologists (Wozniak, Gates), and \ncertainly better designers and artists. But no one else in our era could better firewire together poetry \nand processors in a way that jolted innovation. And \nhe did it with an intuitive feel for business strat -\negy. At almost every product launch over the past \ndecade, Jobs ended with a slide that showed a sign \nat the intersection of Liberal Arts and Technology \nStreets. \nThe creativity that can occur when a feel for both \nthe humanities and the sciences exists in one strong \npersonality was what most interested me in my biog-\nraphies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it \nwill be a key to building innovative economies in the \n21st century. It is the essence of applied imagination, \nand it\u2019s why both the humanities and the sciences are critical for any society that is to have a creative \nedge in the future. \nEven when he was dying, Jobs set his sights \non disrupting more industries. He had a vision for \nturning textbooks into artistic creations that anyone \nwith a Mac could fashion and craft\u2014something that \nApple announced in January 2012. He also dreamed \nof producing magical tools for digital photography \nand ways to make television simple and personal. \nThose, no doubt, will come as well. And even \nthough he will not be around to see them to fruition, \nhis rules for success helped him build a company \nthat not only will create these and other disruptive \nproducts, but will stand at the intersection of cre-\nativity and technology as long as Jobs\u2019s DNA persists at its core.\nStay Hungry,  \nStay Foolish\nSteve Jobs was a product of the two great social \nmovements that emanated from the San Francisco \nBay Area in the late 1960s. The first was the counter-\nculture of hippies and antiwar activists, which was \nmarked by psychedelic drugs, rock music, and anti-\nauthoritarianism. The second was the high-tech and \nhacker culture of Silicon Valley, filled with engineers, geeks, wireheads, phreakers, cyberpunks, hobby -\nists, and garage entrepreneurs. Overlying both were \nvarious paths to personal enlightenment\u2014Zen and \nHinduism, meditation and yoga, primal scream \ntherapy and sensory deprivation, Esalen and est.\nAn admixture of these cultures was found in pub-\nlications such as Stewart Brand\u2019s Whole Earth Cata-\nlog. On its first cover was the famous picture of Earth \ntaken from space, and its subtitle was \u201caccess to tools. \u201d The underlying philosophy was that technol-\nogy could be our friend. Jobs\u2014who became a hippie, \na rebel, a spiritual seeker, a phone phreaker, and an \nelectronic hobbyist all wrapped into one\u2014was a fan. \nHe was particularly taken by the final issue, which \ncame out in 1971, when he was still in high school. \nHe took it with him to college and then to the apple \nfarm commune where he lived after dropping out. \nHe later recalled: \u201cOn the back cover of their final \nissue was a photograph of an early morning coun-\ntry road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhik -\ning on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were \nthe words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. \u2019\u201d Jobs stayed \nhungry and foolish throughout his career by making \nsure that the business and engineering aspect of his \npersonality was always complemented by a hippie \nnonconformist side from his days as an artistic, acid-\ndropping, enlightenment-seeking rebel. In every \naspect of his life\u2014the women he dated, the way he \ndealt with his cancer diagnosis, the way he ran his \nbusiness\u2014his behavior reflected the contradictions, \nconfluence, and eventual synthesis of all these vary -\ning strands. \nEven as Apple became corporate, Jobs asserted \nhis rebel and counterculture streak in its ads, as \nif to proclaim that he was still a hacker and a hip-\npie at heart. The famous \u201c1984\u201d ad showed a ren-\negade woman outrunning the thought police to \nsling a sledgehammer at the screen of an Orwellian \nBig Brother. And when he returned to Apple, Jobs \nhelped write the text for the \u201cThink Different\u201d ads: \n\u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The \ntroublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes\u2026 \u201d \nIf there was any doubt that, consciously or not, he \nwas describing himself, he dispelled it with the \nlast lines: \u201cWhile some see them as the crazy ones, \nwe see genius. Because the people who are crazy \nenough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. \u201d \n hbr r eprint r1204F\nWalter isaacson, the ceo of the aspen Institute, is \nthe author of Steve Jobs and of biographies of Henry \nKissinger, Benjamin Franklin, and albert einstein.No one else in \nour era could better firewire together poetry \nand processors in \na way that jolted innovation.\nApril 2012\u2002Harvard Business r eview\u200211For artIcle reprInts call 800-988-0886 or 617-783-7500, or vIsIt hbr.

Maybe it\u2019s about a project that\u2019s gone \noff track or a manager who\u2019s behaving badly. \nOr maybe they\u2019re not sharing their thoughts \non ways the business could grow its sales or \nimprove operations. No matter how open you \nare as a manager, our research shows, many of \nyour people are more likely to keep mum than to \nquestion initiatives or suggest new ideas at work.\nnational restaurant chain, managers were able to \npersuade senior leaders to make improvements that \nreduced employee turnover by 32% and saved at \nleast $1.6  million a year. \nSo getting all this right pays off\u2014not just for the \nindividuals eager to make contributions but for the \norganizations they want to improve.\nThe Fear Factor\nIt doesn\u2019t take a tyrannical boss to inspire fear within \nan organization. Nor does it matter if an unsettling \nevent like a restructuring or a takeover happened \nlong ago. Once people become afraid to speak their \nminds, they\u2019ll keep justifying their silence with ex \u2011\nplanations like \u201cThat\u2019s the way our culture is\u2014you \ndon\u2019t disagree with your boss. \u201d \nWithout realizing it, leaders tend to make the \nproblem worse with the following practices: \nRelying on anonymous feedback.  The prom \u2011\nise of anonymity is a common way to encourage \nfrank input. Suggestion boxes, whistle \u2011blowing hot \u2011\nlines, ombudspeople, 360 \u2011degree assessments, and \nsatisfaction surveys all serve this purpose. Here\u2019s the \nlogic: If no one knows who said what, no repercus \u2011\nsions will follow, so people can be forthright about \nany topic.\nThis line of reasoning has three flaws.\nFirst, allowing employees to remain unidentified \nactually underscores the risks of speaking up\u2014and \nreinforces people\u2019s fears. The subtext is \u201cIt\u2019s not safe \nto share your views openly in this organization. So This is true even if, like most leaders, you be \u2011\nlieve you have an open \u2011door policy. (In our years \nof studying employee \u201cvoice\u201d and advising orga \u2011\nnizations, we\u2019ve never heard anyone say, \u201cI have a \nclosed \u2011door policy. \u201d) Think about it: How often do \nemployees come to you, on your turf, to tell you \nthe unvarnished truth simply because you\u2019ve en \u2011\ncouraged them to do so? The reality is, they worry\u2014\nrightly or not\u2014that you\u2019ll take their comments per \u2011\nsonally, or that they\u2019ll come across as disrespectful \nknow \u2011it\u2011alls. \nLeaders use a variety of tools to get people to \nspeak up, like \u201cclimate\u201d surveys and all \u2011staff feed \u2011\nback sessions. Many of these efforts focus on improv \u2011\ning communication up and down the hierarchy. But \nthey usually fall short, regardless of good intentions, \nfor two key reasons: a fear of consequences (embar \u2011\nrassment, isolation, low performance ratings, lost \npromotions, and even firing) and a sense of futility \n(the belief that saying something won\u2019t make a differ \u2011\nence, so why bother?). Here, we\u2019ll look at how lead \u2011\ners\u2019 misguided attempts to promote candor fail to ad \u2011\ndress\u2014and sometimes stir up\u2014those feelings. We\u2019ll \nalso discuss tactics that are much more effective. \nIn a number of studies, we\u2019ve found that when \nemployees can voice their concerns freely, organi \u2011\nzations see increased retention and stronger per \u2011\nformance. At several financial services firms, for \nexample, business units whose employees reported \nspeaking up more had significantly better financial \nand operational results than others.

Kaplan Soon after George W. Bush was elected president and before his inauguration in January 2001, there was a quiet assumption among some in Washington that Bush would appoint the traditional Republican senator from Indiana, Dan Coats, as his defense secretary. A second quiet assumption followed that Coats would appoint the bipartisan realist Richard Armitage as deputy defense secretary. Coats and Armitage would no doubt have run the Defense Department from the philosophical vantage point of tough caution in world affairs \u2014 never flinching from a challenge, but also never overreacting. Coats apparently failed his interview with President-elect Bush; or Bush simply had a change of heart. There was reportedly a need to balance Colin Powell at the State Department with an equally towering figure at Defense, and Coats apparently wasn't the one to do that. It was Bush's vice president-elect, Dick Cheney, who reportedly had an idea to solve the dilemma: bring back Donald Rumsfeld, who had already been defense secretary in the Ford Administration in the mid-1970s, and who therefore could both handle the job and stand up to Powell. Rumsfeld became defense secretary and appointed Paul Wolfowitz as his deputy. Armitage, meanwhile, went to work at the State Department as Powell's deputy. Thus, largely because of a series of \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.events involving personnel that few could have predicted, you had the aggressive team of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz reacting to 9/11 rather than the more cautious team of Coats and Armitage. Moreover, you now had a bureaucratic war between the restrained team of Powell and Armitage at the State Department and the newly aggressive team at the Defense Department. Such factors, again, all having to do with personnel, and all exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to predict in advance, would have a profound effect on geopolitics in the ensuing decade. Indeed, the Iraq War, which defined the last decade for American foreign policy, might well not have happened, or, at a minimum, would not have played out at as it did, had Coats become defense secretary. In other words, to say that individuals do not matter amid larger forces is rubbish. Think of World War II without Hitler, of the Balkans without Slobodan Milosevic or Richard Holbrooke, or of Russia in the 1990s without the indiscipline of Boris Yeltsin. Moreover, very odd, utterly unpredictable events matter greatly to world history. Imagine the decade after 9/11 if only a few votes in Florida had shifted \u2014 or if just one Supreme Court vote had shifted \u2014 giving Al Gore the presidency. Would we have gone to war in Afghanistan the way we did? Or gone to war in Iraq at all? And yet events can be forecast. Or rather, trends can be discerned that the daily media regularly miss. They can be forecast because, as I have detailed, while half of reality is utterly unpredictable events involving individuals, the other half is composed of large geographical, demographic, economic and technological forces whose basic trend lines can be foreseen, however vaguely at times. If one concentrates on those larger forces, it still won't be possible to predict, say, the philosophical makeup of a particular president's foreign policy team, but it can be forecast to some impressive degree the kind of world that team will face. 9/11 itself may have been unpredictable, but the trend of an emboldened al Qaeda mixed with further radicalization of the Middle East clearly was predictable. That is why at Stratfor, analysts reduce those larger forces to the constraints placed on individual leaders as a method for forecasting. In other words, such forces as geography, economics and technology limit the parameters within which individual leaders can operate. Those parameters, however, are still broad enough for all sorts of surprising events to happen \u2014 events that are decided by individuals. But the parameters, based on constraints, rule out enough choices so that intelligent forecasting is possible. The difference between the media and Stratfor is that the media often recognizes no limits to what individual policymakers can achieve; Stratfor, while still recognizing human agency, assumes that there often are limits to individual choice. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz may have invaded Iraq, whereas Coats and Armitage might not have. But even Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz had to contend with sectarianism in Iraq, which, in turn, was a product of the country's history and geography that could easily have been forecast in advance. More examples: \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.\u2022 A glance at the map would have revealed in 1989 exactly how the countries of the disbanded Warsaw Pact would perform economically and politically for two decades thereafter: Those in the north \u2014 heirs to the Prussian and Habsburg traditions, like Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic and Slovakia) \u2014 became relative success stories, while the former Byzantine and Ottoman Turkish Balkans would languish in relative economic underdevelopment, political instability and war. \u2022 Russia, whoever leads it, requires buffer zones of a sort in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, owing to its flat geography and history of invasions. Thus, Russia will, for the foreseeable future, miss no opportunity to interfere with the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. \u2022 German leaders want to punish Greece for its economic indiscipline. They don't want Germans to retire at 70 so Greeks can retire at 60. But German leaders also require Greece to be within the Eurozone in order to be a market for German exports. German leaders also find Russia's human rights behavior distasteful, but they cannot pivotally break from Russia while their relationships within the European Union are so delicate. Hence, German leaders' decisions are constrained. \u2022 Israel would like to destroy Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. But the fact that Iran has crossed one red line after another without an Israeli military response demonstrates how the decisions of Israeli leaders are constrained by geography and Israel's own insufficient military capabilities. \u2022 The Obama administration would like to help the Syrian rebels. But it is constrained by the very lack of the rebels' organizational and institutional coherence, which is in turn influenced by sectarian and ethnic divides that are partially determined by history and geography. The theme of the above examples is that leaders face few good choices, hemmed in as they are by history, geography and economics. And without good choices, they often opt for caution. Caution by policymakers further enables forecasting. Of course, not all leaders are cautious, as when Rumsfeld accepted a strategy for invading Iraq without a post-invasion stabilization plan that was fully fleshed out. But usually when policymakers act thus, they pay for it in ways that can be forecast in advance. Forecasting is strongest when it concentrates on geographically- and economically-determinative factors, such as the trajectory of trade routes and the availability of natural resources. For example: What do the new discoveries of shale gas tell us about geopolitics? Stratfor analysts do studies on the geopolitics of iron ore, of coal, and so on. Forecasting is more tenuous when it involves the actions of individuals who can be influenced by the most complex and personal of motives. Thus, predicting what Israel's top decision-makers will do on any given day vis-a-vis Iran can be an iffy enterprise. Nevertheless, because Stratfor has gotten the constraints of Israeli leaders right so far, readers of this website will not be surprised that \u2014 at least until now \u2014 Israel has not attacked Iran, all the anxious media reports going back years to the contrary. Nevertheless, I must emphasize, tomorrow is another day. \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Constraints are about necessity. They are not about the public statements of leaders voicing their often lofty, insipid and subjective desires to the media at press conferences. Finally, forecasting requires humility. The forecaster must always be aware of what he or she does not know and perhaps cannot know. And about what the forecaster does know, he or she must constantly play devil's advocate, as analysts do at Stratfor. But by concentrating on what can be known, as well as on the various larger forces that limit the desires of policymakers, the forecaster has the ability to make readers somewhat less surprised by what happens next. \n Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contact Us   \u00a9 Copyright 2012 Stratfor.

    "Desktop/Cornell/Leadership Skills/HowDavidBeatsGoliath.pdf": "How David Beats Goliath  \nWhen underdogs break the rules.  \nBy Malcolm Gladwell  \n \n \nA non -stop full -court press gives weak basketball teams a chance against far stronger teams. Why have so few \nadopted it?  Credit  ZOHAR LAZAR  \nWhen Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 decided to coach his dau ghter Anjali\u2019s basketball team, he settled on two principles. The \nfirst was that he would never raise his voice. This was National Junior Basketball \u2014the Little League of \nbasketball. The team was made up mostly of twelve -year-olds, and twelve -year-olds, he knew from experience, \ndid not respond well to shouting. He would conduct business on the basketball court, he decided, the same way \nhe conducted business at his software firm. He would speak calmly and softly, and convince the girls of the \nwisdom of his ap proach with appeals to reason and common sense.  \nThe second principle was more important. Ranadiv\u00e9 was puzzled by the way Americans played basketball. He \nis from Mumbai. He grew up with cricket and soccer. He would never forget the first time he saw a baske tball \ngame. He thought it was mindless. Team A would score and then immediately retreat to its own end of the \ncourt. Team B would inbound the ball and dribble it into Team A\u2019s end, where Team A was patiently waiting. \nThen the process would reverse itself. A basketball court was ninety -four feet long. But most of the time a team \ndefended only about twenty -four feet of that, conceding the other seventy feet. Occasionally, teams would play \na full -court press \u2014that is, they would contest their opponent\u2019s attempt  to advance the ball up the court. But they \nwould do it for only a few minutes at a time. It was as if there were a kind of conspiracy in the basketball world \nabout the way the game ought to be played, and Ranadiv\u00e9 thought that that conspiracy had the effe ct of \nwidening the gap between good teams and weak teams. Good teams, after all, had players who were tall and \ncould dribble and shoot well; they could crisply execute their carefully prepared plays in their opponent\u2019s end. \nWhy, then, did weak teams play i n a way that made it easy for good teams to do the very things that made them \nso good?  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Ranadiv\u00e9 looked at his girls. Morgan and Julia were serious basketball players. But Nicky, Angela, Dani, Holly, \nAnnika, and his own daughter, Anjali, had never played th e game before. They weren\u2019t all that tall. They \ncouldn\u2019t shoot. They weren\u2019t particularly adept at dribbling. They were not the sort who played pickup games at \nthe playground every evening. Most of them were, as Ranadiv\u00e9 says, \u201clittle blond girls\u201d from Men lo Park and \nRedwood City, the heart of Silicon Valley. These were the daughters of computer programmers and people with \ngraduate degrees. They worked on science projects, and read books, and went on ski vacations with their \nparents, and dreamed about growi ng up to be marine biologists. Ranadiv\u00e9 knew that if they played the \nconventional way \u2014if they let their opponents dribble the ball up the court without opposition \u2014they would \nalmost certainly lose to the girls for whom basketball was a passion. Ranadiv\u00e9 cam e to America as a seventeen -\nyear-old, with fifty dollars in his pocket. He was not one to accept losing easily. His second principle, then, was \nthat his team would play a real full -court press, every game, all the time. The team ended up at the national \nchampionships. \u201cIt was really random,\u201d Anjali Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cI mean, my father had never played basketball \nbefore.\u201d  \nDavid\u2019s victory over Goliath, in the Biblical account, is held to be an anomaly. It was not. Davids win all the \ntime. The political scientist  Ivan Arregu\u00edn -Toft recently looked at every war fought in the past two hundred \nyears between strong and weak combatants. The Goliaths, he found, won in 71.5 per cent of the cases. That is a \nremarkable fact. Arregu\u00edn -Toft was analyzing conflicts in which o ne side was at least ten times as powerful \u2014in \nterms of armed might and population \u2014as its opponent, and even in those lopsided contests the underdog won \nalmost a third of the time.  \nIn the Biblical story of David and Goliath, David initially put on a coat of  mail and a brass helmet and girded \nhimself with a sword: he prepared to wage a conventional battle of swords against Goliath. But then he stopped. \n\u201cI cannot walk in these, for I am unused to it,\u201d he said (in Robert Alter\u2019s translation), and picked up thos e five \nsmooth stones. What happened, Arregu\u00edn -Toft wondered, when the underdogs likewise acknowledged their \nweakness and chose an unconventional strategy? He went back and re -analyzed his data. In those cases, David\u2019s \nwinning percentage went from 28.5 to 6 3.6. When underdogs choose not to play by Goliath\u2019s rules, they win, \nArregu\u00edn -Toft concluded, \u201c even when everything we think we know about power says they shouldn\u2019t. \u201d \nConsider the way T. E. Lawrence (or, as he is better known, Lawrence of Arabia) led the r evolt against the \nOttoman Army occupying Arabia near the end of the First World War. The British were helping the Arabs in \ntheir uprising, and the initial focus was Medina, the city at the end of a long railroad that the Turks had built, \nrunning south from  Damascus and down through the Hejaz desert. The Turks had amassed a large force in \nMedina, and the British leadership wanted Lawrence to gather the Arabs and destroy the Turkish garrison there, \nbefore the Turks could threaten the entire region.  \nBut when L awrence looked at his ragtag band of Bedouin fighters he realized that a direct attack on Medina \nwould never succeed. And why did taking the city matter, anyway? The Turks sat in Medina \u201con the defensive, \nimmobile.\u201d There were so many of them, consuming so  much food and fuel and water, that they could hardly \nmake a major move across the desert. Instead of attacking the Turks at their point of strength, Lawrence \nreasoned, he ought to attack them where they were weak \u2014along the vast, largely unguarded length o f railway \nline that was their connection to Damascus. Instead of focussing his attention on Medina, he should wage war \nover the broadest territory possible.  \nThe Bedouins under Lawrence\u2019s command were not, in conventional terms, skilled troops. They were n omads. \nSir Reginald Wingate, one of the British commanders in the region, called them \u201can untrained rabble, most of \nwhom have never fired a rifle.\u201d But they were tough and they were mobile. The typical Bedouin soldier carried \nno more than a rifle, a hundre d rounds of ammunition, forty -five pounds of flour, and a pint of drinking water, \nwhich meant that he could travel as much as a hundred and ten miles a day across the desert, even in summer. \n\u201cOur cards were speed and time, not hitting power,\u201d Lawrence wrot e. \u201cOur largest available resources were the \ntribesmen, men quite unused to formal warfare, whose assets were movement, endurance, individual \nintelligence, knowledge of the country, courage.\u201d The eighteenth -century general Maurice de Saxe famously \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.said tha t the art of war was about legs, not arms, and Lawrence\u2019s troops were all legs. In one typical stretch, in \nthe spring of 1917, his men dynamited sixty rails and cut a telegraph line at Buair on March 24th, sabotaged a \ntrain and twenty -five rails at Abu al -Naam on March 25th, dynamited fifteen rails and cut a telegraph line at \nIstabl Antar on March 27th, raided a Turkish garrison and derailed a train on March 29th, returned to Buair and \nsabotaged the railway line again on March 31st, dynamited eleven rails a t Hediah on April 3rd, raided the train \nline in the area of Wadi Dhaiji on April 4th and 5th, and attacked twice on April 6th.  \nLawrence\u2019s masterstroke was an assault on the port town of Aqaba. The Turks expected an attack from British \nships patrolling the waters of the Gulf of Aqaba to the west. Lawrence decided to attack from the east instead, \ncoming at the city from the unprotected desert, and to do that he led his men on an audacious, six -hundred -mile \nloop\u2014up from the Hejaz, north into the Syrian desert,  and then back down toward Aqaba. This was in summer, \nthrough some of the most inhospitable land in the Middle East, and Lawrence tacked on a side trip to the \noutskirts of Damascus, in order to mislead the Turks about his intentions. \u201cThis year the valley seemed creeping \nwith horned vipers and puff -adders, cobras and black snakes,\u201d Lawrence writes in \u201cThe Seven Pillars of \nWisdom\u201d of one stage in the journey:  \nWe could not lightly draw water after dark, for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clusterin g in knots \naround their brinks. Twice puff -adders came twisting into the alert ring of our debating coffee -circle. Three of \nour men died of bites; four recovered after great fear and pain, and a swelling of the poisoned limb. Howeitat \ntreatment was to bind  up the part with snake -skin plaster and read chapters of the Koran to the sufferer until he \ndied.  \nWhen they finally arrived at Aqaba, Lawrence\u2019s band of several hundred warriors killed or captured twelve \nhundred Turks, and lost only two men. The Turks si mply did not think that their opponent would be mad \nenough to come at them from the desert. This was Lawrence\u2019s great insight. David can beat Goliath by \nsubstituting effort for ability \u2014and substituting effort for ability turns out to be a winning formula f or underdogs \nin all walks of life, including little blond -haired girls on the basketball court.  \nVivek Ranadiv\u00e9 is an elegant man, slender and fine -boned, with impeccable manners and a languorous walk. \nHis father was a pilot who was jailed by Indira Gandhi , he says, because he wouldn\u2019t stop challenging the safety \nof India\u2019s planes. Ranadiv\u00e9 went to M.I.T., because he saw a documentary on the school and decided that it was \nperfect for him. This was in the nineteen -seventies, when going abroad for undergradua te study required the \nIndian government to authorize the release of foreign currency, and Ranadiv\u00e9 camped outside the office of the \ngovernor of the Reserve Bank of India until he got his way. The Ranadiv\u00e9s are relentless.  \nIn 1985, Ranadiv\u00e9 founded a software company in Silicon Valley devoted to what in the computer world is \nknown as \u201creal time\u201d processing. If a businessman waits until the end of the month to collect and count his \nreceipts, he\u2019s \u201cbatch processing.\u201d There is a g ap between the events in the company \u2014sales \u2014and his \nunderstanding of those events. Wall Street used to be the same way. The information on which a trader based \nhis decisions was scattered across a number of databases. The trader would collect information fr om here and \nthere, collate and analyze it, and then make a trade. What Ranadiv\u00e9\u2019s company, TIBCO, did was to consolidate \nthose databases into one stream, so that the trader could collect all the data he wanted instantaneously. Batch \nprocessing was replaced  by real -time processing. Today, TIBCO \u2019s software powers most of the trading floors on \nWall Street.  \nRanadiv\u00e9 views this move from batch to real time as a sort of holy mission. The shift, to his mind, is one of \nkind, not just of degree. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with some airlines,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, when you get on a \nplane and your bag doesn\u2019t, they actually know right away that it\u2019s not there. But no one tells you, and a big \npart of that is that they don\u2019t have all their information in one place. There are pas senger systems that know \nwhere the passenger is. There are aircraft and maintenance systems that track where the plane is and what kind \nof shape it\u2019s in. Then, there are baggage systems and ticketing systems \u2014and they\u2019re all separate. So you land, \nyou wait at the baggage terminal, and it doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d Everything bad that happens in that scenario, \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Ranadiv\u00e9 maintains, happens because of the lag between the event (the luggage doesn\u2019t make it onto the plane) \nand the response (the airline tells you that your luggage didn\u2019t make the plane). The lag is why you\u2019re angry. \nThe lag is why you had to wait, fruitlessly, at baggage claim. The lag is why you vow never to fly that airline \nagain. Put all the databases together, and there\u2019s no lag. \u201cWhat we can do is send you a text message the \nmoment we know your bag didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said, \u201ctelling you we\u2019ll ship it to your house.\u201d  \nA few years ago, Ranadiv\u00e9 wrote a paper arguing that even the Federal Reserve ought to make its decisions in \nreal time \u2014not once every month or two. \u201cEverything in the world is now real time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when a \ncertain type of shoe isn\u2019t selling at your corner shop, it\u2019s not six months before the guy in China finds out. It\u2019s \nalmost instantaneous, thanks to my software. The world runs in  real time, but government runs in batch. Every \nfew months, it adjusts. Its mission is to keep the temperature comfortable in the economy, and, if you were to do \nthings the government\u2019s way in your house, then every few months you\u2019d turn the heater either on or off, \noverheating or underheating your house.\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 argued that we ought to put the economic data that the Fed \nuses into a big stream, and write a computer program that sifts through those data, the moment they are \ncollected, and make immediate, i ncremental adjustments to interest rates and the money supply. \u201cIt can all be \nautomated,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve had only one soft landing since the Second World War. Basically, we\u2019ve got \nit wrong every single time.\u201d  \nYou can imagine what someone like Alan Greenspan or Ben Bernanke might say about that idea. Such people \nare powerfully invested in the notion of the Fed as a Solomonic body: that pause of five or eight weeks between \neconomic adjustments seems central to the process of deliberation. To Ranadiv\u00e9,  though, \u201cdeliberation\u201d just \nprettifies the difficulties created by lag. The Fed has to deliberate because it\u2019s several weeks behind, the same \nway the airline has to bow and scrape and apologize because it waited forty -five minutes to tell you something \nthat it could have told you the instant you stepped off the plane.  \nIs it any wonder that Ranadiv\u00e9 looked at the way basketball was played and found it mindless? A professional \nbasketball game was forty -eight minutes long, divided up into alternating possessi ons of roughly twenty \nseconds: back and forth, back and forth. But a good half of each twenty -second increment was typically taken \nup with preliminaries and formalities. The point guard dribbled the ball up the court. He stood above the top of \nthe key, abo ut twenty -four feet from the opposing team\u2019s basket. He called out a play that the team had \nchoreographed a hundred times in practice. It was only then that the defending team sprang into action, actively \ncontesting each pass and shot. Actual basketball to ok up only half of that twenty -second interval, so that a \ngame\u2019s real length was not forty -eight minutes but something closer to twenty -four minutes \u2014and that twenty -\nfour minutes of activity took place within a narrowly circumscribed area. It was as formal and as convention -\nbound as an eighteenth -century quadrille. The supporters of that dance said that the defensive players had to run \nback to their own end, in order to compose themselves for the arrival of the other team. But the reason they had \nto compose themselves, surely, was that by retreating they allowed the offense to execute a play that it had \npracticed to perfection. Basketball was batch!  \nInsurgents, though, operate in real time. Lawrence hit the Turks, in that stretch in the spring of 1917, nearly  \nevery day, because he knew that the more he accelerated the pace of combat the more the war became a battle \nof endurance \u2014and endurance battles favor the insurgent. \u201cAnd it happened as the Philistine arose and was \ndrawing near David that David hastened and  ran out from the lines toward the Philistine,\u201d the Bible says. \u201cAnd \nhe reached his hand into the pouch and took from there a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine in his \nforehead.\u201d The second sentence \u2014the slingshot part \u2014is what made David famous. B ut the first sentence matters \njust as much. David broke the rhythm of the encounter. He speeded it up. \u201cThe sudden astonishment when \nDavid sprints forward must have frozen Goliath, making him a better target,\u201d the poet and critic Robert Pinsky \nwrites in \u201cT he Life of David.\u201d Pinsky calls David a \u201cpoint guard ready to flick the basketball here or there.\u201d \nDavid pressed . That\u2019s what Davids do when they want to beat Goliaths.  \nRanadiv\u00e9\u2019s basketball team played in the National Junior Basketball seventh -and-eighth -grade division, \nrepresenting Redwood City. The girls practiced at Paye\u2019s Place, a gym in nearby San Carlos. Because Ranadiv\u00e9 \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.had never played basketball, he recruited a series of experts to help him. The first was Roger Craig, the former \nall-pro running ba ck for the San Francisco 49ers, who is also TIBCO \u2019s director of business development. As a \nfootball player, Craig was legendary for the off -season hill workouts he put himself through. Most of his N.F.L. \nteammates are now hobbling around golf courses. He h as run seven marathons. After Craig signed on, he \nrecruited his daughter Rometra, who played Division I basketball at Duke and U.S.C. Rometra was the kind of \nperson you assigned to guard your opponent\u2019s best player in order to shut her down. The girls love d Rometra. \n\u201cShe has always been like my big sister,\u201d Anjali Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cIt was so awesome to have her along.\u201d  \nRedwood City\u2019s strategy was built around the two deadlines that all basketball teams must meet in order to \nadvance the ball. The first is the inbounds pass. When one team scores, a player from the other team takes the \nball out of bounds and has five seconds to pass it to a teammate on the court. If that deadline is missed, the ball \ngoes to the other team. Usually, that\u2019s not an issue, because te ams don\u2019t contest the inbounds pass. They run \nback to their own end. Redwood City did not. Each girl on the team closely shadowed her counterpart. When \nsome teams play the press, the defender plays behind the offensive player she\u2019s guarding, to impede her once \nshe catches the ball. The Redwood City girls, by contrast, played in front of their opponents, to prevent them \nfrom catching the inbounds pass in the first place. And they didn\u2019t guard the player throwing the ball in. Why \nbother? Ranadiv\u00e9 used that ex tra player as a floater, who could serve as a second defender against the other \nteam\u2019s best player. \u201cThink about football,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cThe quarterback can run with the ball. He has the \nwhole field to throw to, and it\u2019s still damned difficult to comple te a pass.\u201d Basketball was harder. A smaller \ncourt. A five -second deadline. A heavier, bigger ball. As often as not, the teams Redwood City was playing \nagainst simply couldn\u2019t make the inbounds pass within the five -second limit. Or the inbounding player, \npanicked by the thought that her five seconds were about to be up, would throw the ball away. Or her pass \nwould be intercepted by one of the Redwood City players. Ranadiv\u00e9\u2019s girls were maniacal.  \nThe second deadline requires a team to advance the ball across  mid-court, into its opponent\u2019s end, within ten \nseconds, and if Redwood City\u2019s opponents met the first deadline the girls would turn their attention to the \nsecond. They would descend on the girl who caught the inbounds pass and \u201ctrap\u201d her. Anjali was the d esignated \ntrapper. She\u2019d sprint over and double -team the dribbler, stretching her long arms high and wide. Maybe she\u2019d \nsteal the ball. Maybe the other player would throw it away in a panic \u2014or get bottled up and stalled, so that the \nref would end up blowing  the whistle. \u201cWhen we first started out, no one knew how to play defense or \nanything,\u201d Anjali said. \u201cSo my dad said the whole game long, \u2018Your job is to guard someone and make sure \nthey never get the ball on inbounds plays.\u2019 It\u2019s the best feeling in the w orld to steal the ball from someone. We \nwould press and steal, and do that over and over again. It made people so nervous. There were teams that were a \nlot better than us, that had been playing a long time, and we would beat them.\u201d  \nThe Redwood City players  would jump ahead 4 \u20130, 6\u20130, 8\u20130, 12 \u20130. One time, they led 25 \u20130. Because they \ntypically got the ball underneath their opponent\u2019s basket, they rarely had to take low -percentage, long -range \nshots that required skill and practice. They shot layups. In one of t he few games that Redwood City lost that \nyear, only four of the team\u2019s players showed up. They pressed anyway. Why not? They lost by three points.  \n\u201cWhat that defense did for us is that we could hide our weaknesses,\u201d Rometra Craig said. She helped out once  \nRedwood City advanced to the regional championships. \u201cWe could hide the fact that we didn\u2019t have good \noutside shooters. We could hide the fact that we didn\u2019t have the tallest lineup, because as long as we played \nhard on defense we were getting steals and getting easy layups. I was honest with the girls. I told them, \u2018We\u2019re \nnot the best basketball team out there.\u2019 But they understood their roles.\u201d A twelve -year-old girl would go to war \nfor Rometra. \u201cThey were awesome,\u201d she said.  \nLawrence attacked the Turks where they were weak \u2014the railroad \u2014and not where they were strong, Medina. \nRedwood City attacked the inbounds pass, the point in a game where a great team is as vulnerable as a weak \none. Lawrence extended the battlefield over as large an area as possible. S o did the girls of Redwood City. They \ndefended all ninety -four feet. The full -court press is legs, not arms. It supplants ability with effort. It is \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.basketball for those \u201cquite unused to formal warfare, whose assets were movement, endurance, individual \nintelligence . . . courage.\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting  strategy,\u201d Roger Craig said. He and Ranadiv\u00e9 were in a TIBCO  conference room, reminiscing \nabout their dream season. Ranadiv\u00e9 was at the whiteboard, diagramming the intricacies of the Redwood City \npress. Craig w as sitting at the table.  \n\u201cMy girls had to be more fit than the others,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said.  \n\u201cHe used to make them run,\u201d Craig said, nodding approvingly.  \n\u201cWe followed soccer strategy in practice,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cI would make them run and run and run. I couldn\u2019 t \nteach them skills in that short period of time, and so all we did was make sure they were fit and had some basic \nunderstanding of the game. That\u2019s why attitude plays such a big role in this, because you\u2019re going to get tired.\u201d \nHe turned to Craig. \u201cWhat w as our cheer again?\u201d  \nThe two men thought for a moment, then shouted out happily, in unison, \u201cOne, two, three, ATTITUDE !\u201d  \nThat was it! The whole Redwood City philosophy was based on a willingness to try harder than anyone else.  \n\u201cOne time, some new girls j oined the team,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said, \u201cand so in the first practice I had I was telling them, \n\u2018Look, this is what we\u2019re going to do,\u2019 and I showed them. I said, \u2018It\u2019s all about attitude.\u2019 And there was this \none new girl on the team, and I was worried that she wo uldn\u2019t get the whole attitude thing. Then we did the \ncheer and she said, \u2018No, no, it\u2019s not One, two three, ATTITUDE . It\u2019s One, two, three, attitude HAH \u2019 \u201d\u2014at which \npoint Ranadiv\u00e9 and Craig burst out laughing.  \nIn January of 1971, the Fordham University Ram s played a basketball game against the University of \nMassachusetts Redmen. The game was in Amherst, at the legendary arena known as the Cage, where the \nRedmen hadn\u2019t lost since December of 1969. Their record was 11 \u20131. The Redmen\u2019s star was none other than \nJulius Erving \u2014Dr. J. The UMass team was very, very good. Fordham, by contrast, was a team of scrappy kids \nfrom the Bronx and Brooklyn. Their center had torn up his knee the first week of the season, which meant that \ntheir tallest player was six feet five. Their starting forward \u2014and forwards are typically almost as tall as \ncenters \u2014was Charlie Yelverton, who was six feet two. But from the opening buzzer the Rams launched a full -\ncourt press, and never let up. \u201cWe jumped out to a thirteen -to-six lead, and it wa s a war the rest of the way,\u201d \nDigger Phelps, the Fordham coach at the time, recalls. \u201cThese were tough city kids. We played you ninety -four \nfeet. We knew that sooner or later we were going to make you crack.\u201d Phelps sent in one indefatigable Irish or \nItalian kid from the Bronx after another to guard Erving, and, one by one, the indefatigable Irish and Italian kids \nfouled out. None of them were as good as Erving. It didn\u2019t matter. Fordham won, 87 \u201379. \nIn the world of basketball, there is one story after anoth er like this about legendary games where David used the \nfull-court press to beat Goliath. Yet the puzzle of the press is that it has never become popular. People look at \nupsets like Fordham over UMass and call them flukes. Basketball sages point out that t he press can be beaten by \na well -coached team with adept ball handlers and astute passers \u2014and that is true. Ranadiv\u00e9 readily admitted \nthat all an opposing team had to do to beat Redwood City was press back: the girls were not good enough to \nhandle their ow n medicine. Playing insurgent basketball did not guarantee victory. It was simply the best chance \nan underdog had of beating Goliath. If Fordham had played UMass the conventional way, it would have lost by \nthirty points. And yet somehow that lesson has esc aped the basketball establishment.  \nWhat did Digger Phelps do, the season after his stunning upset of UMass? He never used the full -court press the \nsame way again. The UMass coach, Jack Leaman, was humbled in his own gym by a bunch of street kids. Did \nhe le arn from his defeat and use the press himself the next time he had a team of underdogs? He did not.  \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.The only person who seemed to have absorbed the lessons of that game was a skinny little guard on the UMass \nfreshman team named Rick Pitino. He didn\u2019t play that day. He watched, and his eyes grew wide. Even now, \nthirty -eight years later, he can name, from memory, nearly every player on the Fordham team: Yelverton, \nSullivan, Mainor, Charles, Zambetti. \u201cThey came in with the most unbelievable pressing team I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d \nPitino said. \u201cFive guys between six feet five and six feet. It was unbelievable how they covered ground. I \nstudied it. There is no way they should have beaten us. Nobody beat us at the Cage.\u201d  \nPitino became the head coach at Boston University in  1978, when he was twenty -five years old, and used the \npress to take the school to its first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance in twenty -four years. At his next head -\ncoaching stop, Providence College, Pitino took over a team that had gone 11 \u201320 the year befor e. The players \nwere short and almost entirely devoid of talent \u2014a carbon copy of the Fordham Rams. They pressed, and ended \nup one game away from playing for the national championship. At the University of Kentucky, in the mid -\nnineteen -nineties, Pitino took his team to the Final Four three times \u2014and won a national championship \u2014with \nfull-court pressure, and then rode the full -court press back to the Final Four in 2005, as the coach at the \nUniversity of Louisville. This year, his Louisville team entered the N.C .A.A. tournament ranked No. 1 in the \nland. College coaches of Pitino\u2019s calibre typically have had numerous players who have gone on to be bona -fide \nall-stars at the professional level. In his many years of coaching, Pitino has had one, Antoine Walker. It d oesn\u2019t \nmatter. Every year, he racks up more and more victories.  \n\u201cThe greatest example of the press I\u2019ve ever coached was my Kentucky team in \u201996, when we played L.S.U.,\u201d \nPitino said. He was at the athletic building at the University of Louisville, in a sma ll room filled with television \nscreens, where he watches tapes of opponents\u2019 games. \u201cDo we have that tape?\u201d Pitino called out to an assistant. \nHe pulled a chair up close to one of the monitors. The game began with Kentucky stealing the ball from L.S.U., \ndeep in L.S.U.\u2019s end. Immediately, the ball was passed to Antoine Walker, who cut to the basket for a layup. \nL.S.U. got the ball back. Kentucky stole it again. Another easy basket by Walker. \u201cWalker had almost thirty \npoints at halftime,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cHe dun ked it almost every time. When we steal, he just runs to the basket.\u201d \nThe Kentucky players were lightning quick and long -armed, and swarmed around the L.S.U. players, arms \nflailing. It was mayhem. Five minutes in, it was clear that L.S.U. was panicking.  \nPitino trains his players to look for what he calls the \u201crush state\u201d in their opponents \u2014that moment when the \nplayer with the ball is shaken out of his tempo \u2014and L.S.U. could not find a way to get out of the rush state. \n\u201cSee if you find one play that L.S.U. m anaged to run,\u201d Pitino said. You couldn\u2019t. The L.S.U. players struggled \nto get the ball inbounds, and, if they did that, they struggled to get the ball over mid -court, and on those \noccasions when they managed both those things they were too overwhelmed and  exhausted to execute their \noffense the way they had been trained to. \u201cWe had eighty -six points at halftime,\u201d Pitino went on \u2014eighty -six \npoints being, of course, what college basketball teams typically score in an entire game. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019d \nforced twent y-three turnovers at halftime,\u201d twenty -three turnovers being what college basketball teams might \nforce in two games. \u201cI love watching this,\u201d Pitino said. He had a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cEvery day, you \ndream about getting a team like this again.\u201d So why  are there no more than a handful of college teams who use \nthe full -court press the way Pitino does?  \nArregu\u00edn -Toft found the same puzzling pattern. When an underdog fought like David, he usually won. But most \nof the time underdogs didn\u2019t  fight like David. Of the two hundred and two lopsided conflicts in Arregu\u00edn -Toft\u2019s \ndatabase, the underdog chose to go toe to toe with Goliath the conventional way a hundred and fifty -two \ntimes \u2014and lost a hundred and nineteen times. In 1809, the Peruvians fought the Spanish straight up and lost; in \n1816, the Georgians fought the Russians straight up and lost; in 1817, the Pindaris fought the British straight up \nand lost; in the Kandyan rebellion of 1817, the Sri Lankans fought the British straight up and lost; in 1823, the \nBurmese chose to fight the British straight up and lost. The list of failures was endless. In the nineteen -forties, \nthe Communist insurgency in Vietnam bedevilled the French until, in 1951, the Viet Minh strategist Vo Nguyen \nGiap switched to conventional war fare\u2014and promptly suffered a series of defeats. George Washington did the \nsame in the American Revolution, abandoning the guerrilla tactics that had served the colonists so well in the \nconflict\u2019s early stages. \u201cAs quickly as he could,\u201d William Polk writes in \u201cViolent Politics,\u201d a history of \nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.unconventional warfare, Washington \u201cdevoted his energies to creating a British -type army, the Continental \nLine. As a result, he was defeated time after time and almost lost the war.\u201d  \nIt makes no sense, unless you think b ack to that Kentucky -L.S.U. game and to Lawrence\u2019s long march across \nthe desert to Aqaba. It is easier to dress soldiers in bright uniforms and have them march to the sound of a fife -\nand-drum corps than it is to have them ride six hundred miles through the  desert on the back of a camel. It is \neasier to retreat and compose yourself after every score than swarm about, arms flailing. We tell ourselves that \nskill is the precious resource and effort is the commodity. It\u2019s the other way around. Effort can trump a bility \u2014\nlegs, in Saxe\u2019s formulation, can overpower arms \u2014because relentless effort is in fact something rarer than the \nability to engage in some finely tuned act of motor co\u00f6rdination.  \n\u201cI have so many coaches come in every year to learn the press,\u201d Pitino s aid. Louisville was the Mecca for all \nthose Davids trying to learn how to beat Goliaths. \u201cThen they e -mail me. They tell me they can\u2019t do it. They \ndon\u2019t know if they have the bench. They don\u2019t know if the players can last.\u201d Pitino shook his head. \u201cWe \npract ice every day for two hours straight,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe players are moving almost ninety -eight per cent of \nthe practice. We spend very little time talking. When we make our corrections\u201d \u2014that is, when Pitino and his \ncoaches stop play to give instruction \u2014\u201cthey are seven -second corrections, so that our heart rate never rests. We \nare always working.\u201d Seven seconds! The coaches who came to Louisville sat in the stands and watched that \nceaseless activity and despaired. The prospect of playing by David\u2019s rules was  too daunting. They would rather \nlose. \nIn 1981, a computer scientist from Stanford University named Doug Lenat entered the Traveller Trillion Credit \nSquadron tournament, in San Mateo, California. It was a war game. The contestants had been given several \nvolumes of rules, well beforehand, and had been asked to design their own fleet of warships with a mythical \nbudget of a trillion dollars. The fleets then squared off against one another in the cours e of a weekend. \u201cImagine \nthis enormous auditorium area with tables, and at each table people are paired off,\u201d Lenat said. \u201cThe winners go \non and advance. The losers get eliminated, and the field gets smaller and smaller, and the audience gets larger \nand la rger.\u201d  \nLenat had developed an artificial -intelligence program that he called Eurisko, and he decided to feed his \nprogram the rules of the tournament. Lenat did not give Eurisko any advice or steer the program in any \nparticular strategic direction. He was not a war -gamer. He simply let Eurisko figure things out for itself. For \nabout a month, for ten hours every night on a hundred computers at Xerox PARC , in Palo Alto, Eurisko ground \naway at the problem, until it came out with an answer. Most teams fielded s ome version of a traditional naval \nfleet\u2014an array of ships of various sizes, each well defended against enemy attack. Eurisko thought differently. \n\u201cThe program came up with a strategy of spending the trillion on an astronomical number of small ships like \nP.T. boats, with powerful weapons but absolutely no defense and no mobility,\u201d Lenat said. \u201cThey just sat there. \nBasically, if they were hit once they would sink. And what happened is that the enemy would take its shots, and \nevery one of those shots would si nk our ships. But it didn\u2019t matter, because we had so many.\u201d Lenat won the \ntournament in a runaway.  \nThe next year, Lenat entered once more, only this time the rules had changed. Fleets could no longer just sit \nthere. Now one of the criteria of success in battle was fleet \u201cagility.\u201d Eurisko went back to work. \u201cWhat Eurisko \ndid was say that if any of our ships got damaged it would sink itself \u2014and that would raise fleet agility back up \nagain,\u201d Lenat said. Eurisko won again.  \nEurisko was an underdog. The other  gamers were people steeped in military strategy and history. They were the \nsort who could tell you how Wellington had outfoxed Napoleon at Waterloo, or what exactly happened at \nAntietam. They had been raised on Dungeons and Dragons. They were insiders. Eu risko, on the other hand, \nknew nothing but the rule book. It had no common sense. As Lenat points out, a human being understands the \nmeaning of the sentences \u201cJohnny robbed a bank.

But it was precisely that outsiderness that led to Eurisko\u2019s \nvictory: not knowing the conventions of the game t urned out to be an advantage.  \n\u201cEurisko was exposing the fact that any finite set of rules is going to be a very incomplete approximation of \nreality,\u201d Lenat explained. \u201cWhat the other entrants were doing was filling in the holes in the rules with real -\nworld , realistic answers. But Eurisko didn\u2019t have that kind of preconception, partly because it didn\u2019t know \nenough about the world.\u201d So it found solutions that were, as Lenat freely admits, \u201csocially horrifying\u201d: send a \nthousand defenseless and immobile ships i nto battle; sink your own ships the moment they get damaged.  \nThis is the second half of the insurgent\u2019s creed. Insurgents work harder than Goliath. But their other advantage \nis that they will do what is \u201csocially horrifying\u201d \u2014they will challenge the conven tions about how battles are \nsupposed to be fought. All the things that distinguish the ideal basketball player are acts of skill and \nco\u00f6rdination. When the game becomes about effort over ability, it becomes unrecognizable \u2014a shocking \nmixture of broken plays  and flailing limbs and usually competent players panicking and throwing the ball out of \nbounds. You have to be outside the establishment \u2014a foreigner new to the game or a skinny kid from New York \nat the end of the bench \u2014to have the audacity to play it that  way. George Washington couldn\u2019t do it. His dream, \nbefore the war, was to be a British Army officer, finely turned out in a red coat and brass buttons. He found the \nguerrillas who had served the American Revolution so well to be \u201can exceeding dirty and nas ty people.\u201d He \ncouldn\u2019t fight the establishment, because he was the establishment.  \nT. E. Lawrence, by contrast, was the farthest thing from a proper British Army officer. He did not graduate with \nhonors from Sandhurst. He was an archeologist by trade, a dr eamy poet. He wore sandals and full Bedouin \ndress when he went to see his military superiors. He spoke Arabic like a native, and handled a camel as if he \nhad been riding one all his life. And David, let\u2019s not forget, was a shepherd. He came at Goliath with  a slingshot \nand staff because those were the tools of his trade. He didn\u2019t know that duels with Philistines were supposed to \nproceed formally, with the crossing of swords. \u201cWhen the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep \nfrom the herd, I would go out after him and strike him down and rescue it from his clutches,\u201d David explained \nto Saul. He brought a shepherd\u2019s rules to the battlefield.  \nThe price that the outsider pays for being so heedless of custom is, of course, the disapproval of the insider . \nWhy did the Ivy League schools of the nineteen -twenties limit the admission of Jewish immigrants? Because \nthey were the establishment and the Jews were the insurgents, scrambling and pressing and playing by \nimmigrant rules that must have seemed to the Wa sp \u00e9lite of the time to be socially horrifying. \u201cTheir \naccomplishment is well over a hundred per cent of their ability on account of their tremendous energy and \nambition,\u201d the dean of Columbia College said of the insurgents from Brooklyn, the Bronx, and th e Lower East \nSide. He wasn\u2019t being complimentary. Goliath does not simply dwarf David. He brings the full force of social \nconvention against him; he has contempt for David.  \n\u201cIn the beginning, everyone laughed at our fleet,\u201d Lenat said. \u201cIt was really emba rrassing. People felt sorry for \nus. But somewhere around the third round they stopped laughing, and some time around the fourth round they \nstarted complaining to the judges. When we won again, some people got very angry, and the tournament \ndirectors basica lly said that it was not really in the spirit of the tournament to have these weird computer -\ndesigned fleets winning. They said that if we entered again they would stop having the tournament. I decided \nthe best thing to do was to graciously bow out.\u201d  \nIt isn\u2019t surprising that the tournament directors found Eurisko\u2019s strategies beyond the pale. It\u2019s wrong  to sink \nyour own ships, they believed. And they were right. But let\u2019s remember who made that rule: Goliath. And let\u2019s \nremember why Goliath made that rule: w hen the world has to play on Goliath\u2019s terms, Goliath wins.  \nThe trouble for Redwood City started early in the regular season. The opposing coaches began to get angry. \nThere was a sense that Redwood City wasn\u2019t playing fair \u2014that it wasn\u2019t right to use the f ull-court press against \ntwelve -year-old girls, who were just beginning to grasp the rudiments of the game.

Of course, you could as easily argue that in playing the \npress a  twelve -year-old girl learned something much more valuable \u2014that effort can trump ability and that \nconventions are made to be challenged. But the coaches on the other side of Redwood City\u2019s lopsided scores \nwere disinclined to be so philosophical.  \n\u201cThere wa s one guy who wanted to have a fight with me in the parking lot,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cHe was this big \nguy. He obviously played football and basketball himself, and he saw that skinny, foreign guy beating him at \nhis own game. He wanted to beat me up.\u201d  \nRoger Cra ig says that he was sometimes startled by what he saw. \u201cThe other coaches would be screaming at \ntheir girls, humiliating them, shouting at them. They would say to the refs \u2014\u2018That\u2019s a foul! That\u2019s a foul!\u2019 But \nwe weren\u2019t fouling. We were just playing aggress ive defense.\u201d  \n\u201cMy girls were all blond -haired white girls,\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cMy daughter is the closest we have to a black girl, \nbecause she\u2019s half -Indian. One time, we were playing this all -black team from East San Jose. They had been \nplaying for years. Th ese were born -with-a-basketball girls. We were just crushing them. We were up something \nlike twenty to zero. We wouldn\u2019t even let them inbound the ball, and the coach got so mad that he took a chair \nand threw it. He started screaming at his girls, and of c ourse the more you scream at girls that age the more \nnervous they get.\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 shook his head: never, ever raise your voice. \u201cFinally, the ref physically threw him \nout of the building. I was afraid. I think he couldn\u2019t stand it because here were all thes e blond -haired girls who \nwere clearly inferior players, and we were killing them.\u201d  \nAt the nationals, the Redwood City girls won their first two games. In the third round, their opponents were \nfrom somewhere deep in Orange County. Redwood City had to play t hem on their own court, and the opponents \nsupplied their own referee as well. The game was at eight o\u2019clock in the morning. The Redwood City players \nleft their hotel at six, to beat the traffic. It was downhill from there. The referee did not believe in \u201cO ne, two, \nthree, attitude HAH.\u201d He didn\u2019t think that playing to deny the inbounds pass was basketball. He began calling \none foul after another.  \n\u201cThey were touch fouls,\u201d Craig said. Ticky -tacky stuff. The memory was painful.  \n\u201cMy girls didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Ra nadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cThe ref called something like four times as many fouls on us as \non the other team.\u201d  \n\u201cPeople were booing,\u201d Craig said. \u201cIt was bad.\u201d  \n\u201cA two -to-one ratio is understandable, but a ratio of four to one?\u201d Ranadiv\u00e9 shook his head.  \n\u201cOne girl foule d out.\u201d  \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get blown out. There was still a chance to win. But . . .\u201d  \nRanadiv\u00e9 called the press off. He had to. The Redwood City players retreated to their own end, and passively \nwatched as their opponents advanced down the court. They did not run . They paused and deliberated between \neach possession.

What I\u2019ve seen \nin the course of my research, though, \ntells a more nuanced story. Most acts of \ncourage don\u2019t come from whistleblowers \nor organizational martyrs. Instead, they \ncome from respected insiders at all levels \nwho take action\u2014be it campaigning for a \nrisky strategic move, pushing to change \nan unfair policy, or speaking out against \nunethical behavior\u2014because they believe \nit\u2019s the right thing to do. Their reputations \nand track records enable them to make \nmore headway than those on the margins \nor outside the organization could. And \nwhen they manage the process well, they \ndon\u2019t necessarily pay a high price for their \nactions; indeed, they may see their status \nrise as they create positive change.\nConsider Martha (not her real name), \na finance manager at a small company. \nFor years she endured risqu\u00e9 comments \nand sexual innuendo from her boss, the \ncompany president, and she struggled with \nhow to handle it: Should she talk to him \nabout his behavior, or just quit? How could she protect the other women at the firm? \nThen, at a staff gathering, her boss grabbed \nher inappropriately during a light moment, \nthinking it was funny. Later that day, she \nconfronted him in his office, prepared to \nquit if he made no changes. She told him \nthat his behavior made her uncomfortable \nand was a signal to her that she\u2019d never \nadvance in the company because he didn\u2019t \nview her as an equal. She said that perhaps \nhe was trying to promote a fun work envi -\nronment, but he was failing.\nMartha was terrified that he would fire \nher, be angry, or tell her to toughen up.  \nBut instead, to her surprise, he apolo -\ngized. He was horrified that this was how \nshe felt\u2014and that other women in the \ncompany probably felt the same way. \nHe praised her for speaking out when no \none else had dared to. Over subsequent \nmonths, he continued to seek her guidance \non the issue and made a formal apology to \nthe staff. A year later, Martha was pro -\nmoted to a VP role: an incredible position \nto be in for someone who once believed \nthat the president would never promote  \na woman to that level.\nManaging  \nYourself\n4    Harvard Business Review\nNovember\u2013December 2018\nPrevious page: Christopher Penler/Alamy Stock Photo\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.Mark Lennihan/Associated Press\nHarvard Business Review\u2002\nNovember\u2013December 2018     5\nThis document is authorized for use by Amir Hossain, from 2024-03-14 to 2024-06-14 in the course:\n NBAY 6320: Core Leadership Skills for VUCA World - Casey (Spring 2024), Cornell University\nAny unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited.I began investigating workplace courage after spending \nmore than a decade studying why people so often don\u2019t \nspeak up at work. I\u2019ve found many examples of people \nat all levels who created positive change without ruining \ntheir careers. Their success rested primarily on a set of \nattitudes and behaviors that can be learned, rather than \non innate characteristics. I call people who exhibit these \nbehaviors competently courageous  because they create the \nright conditions for action by establishing a strong internal \nreputation and by improving their fallback options in case \nthings go poorly; they carefully choose their battles, discern -\ning whether a given opportunity to act makes sense in light \nof their values, the timing, and their broader objectives; they \nmaximize the odds of in-the-moment success by managing \nthe messaging and emotions; and they follow up to preserve \nrelationships and marshal commitment. These steps are \nuseful whether you\u2019re pushing for major change or trying to \naddress a smaller or more local issue.\nLest anyone think I\u2019m naive, let me be clear: Of course \nbad things do happen when people challenge authorities, \nnorms, and institutions. Courage, after all, is about taking \nworthy actions despite the potential risk.  If no one ever got \nfired, was socially isolated, or suffered other consequences \nfor a particular action, we wouldn\u2019t consider it courageous. \nAnd good outcomes are more likely to come from some types \nof actions than from others. For example, challenging the \ninappropriate behavior of a colleague with whom you have a \ndecent relationship is, all else being equal, likely to go better \nfor you than defying the entire power structure over an \nunethical practice.\nAmong those I studied who had failed to create positive \nchange, almost all still thought their risk-taking had been \nthe right thing to do. They were proud they had stood up for \nwhat they believed in\u2014but they wished they\u2019d done so more \nskillfully. Following the four principles laid out here can help \npeople at all levels improve their chances of creating positive \nchange when they do decide to act.\nLaying the Groundwork\nMy research shows that employees whose workplace \ncourage produces good results have often spent months or \nyears establishing that they excel at their jobs, that they are invested in the organization, and that they\u2019re evenhanded. \nThey\u2019ve demonstrated that they\u2019re able to stand both apart \nfrom and with those whose support they need. In doing so, \nthey\u2019ve accumulated what psychologists call idiosyncrasy \ncredits\u2014a stock of goodwill derived from their history of \ncompetence and conformity\u2014which they can cash in when \nchallenging norms or those with more power. (I\u2019ve also seen \nthe reverse: When people with a reputation for selfishness or \nill will stand up for legitimately needed change, they tend to \nbe less successful.)\nCompetently courageous people also work to earn the \ntrust of those who see them as their champions. They invest \nin those relationships, too\u2014engaging with people individ -\nually, taking the time to empathize with them, and helping \nthem develop professionally.\nConsider Catherine Gill, a former senior vice president \nof fundraising and communication at the nonprofit social \ninvestment fund Root Capital. Gill wanted to speak up about \nwhat she and colleagues saw as the organization\u2019s uninten -\ntional yet manifest internal bias against women. The issue \nwas particularly tricky because criticizing the leadership \ncould easily be viewed as criticizing the organization\u2019s \nsocially conscious mission. But she was able to launch an \nhonest\u2014if painful\u2014conversation with her colleagues in \nsenior management about the organization\u2019s culture, leading \nto a number of concrete changes.\nGill\u2019s track rec  ord of excelling and fitting in at the orga -\nnization was fundamental to her success. Over her first \ntwo years at Root Capital, she achieved consistently high \nperformance as a fundraiser and exhibited the emotional \nand intellectual intelligence to navigate complex issues. She \nshowed that she was deeply committed to the organization\u2019s \nmission, regularly adjusting her role to tackle the most \npressing challenges and showing how various initiatives she \nlaunched were aligned with core strategic priorities. She was \ncareful to point out when she didn\u2019t consider something a \ngender issue so that people on both sides would see her as \nfair. All that gave her the idiosyncrasy credits she needed to \nbe heard by the leadership team. She determined the limits \nof what change was possible so that she wouldn\u2019t push too \nfar and get \u201cvoted off the island. \u201d Through her work ethic, \njudgment, and humor, she set the stage for more visible \nmoments of courageous action.\nManaging  \nYourself\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2018 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION.

Pushing for a more glob -\nally representative strategy or leadership team, for example, \nwas for a long time risky in many organizations; now compa -\nnies are more open to tackling those issues. Unless they\u2019ve \nconcluded that taking action is necessary to preserve their \nsense of integrity or to plant the seed of an idea, competently \ncourageous people don\u2019t act before those around them are \nready to take them seriously.\nFor example, when \u201cMandy\u201d joined an accessories and \napparel company as a product manager, she quickly learned \nthat one of the company\u2019s vendors was highly problematic. \nIts reps were rude, dishonest, and manipulative, and the \nproduct itself was subpar. However, ties between the two \ncompanies were long-standing and included a friendship \nbetween two key managers. Mandy wisely waited; she didn\u2019t \nsuggest a change until six months later. By that point she had \ndemonstrated her commitment to the organization, and she \nwas better able to gauge the relationships between the people \ninvolved. She used the intervening time to collect evidence of \nthe problems, identify alternative vendors, and quantify the \nimprovements they could offer. When she finally did make \nher proposal, the VP in charge responded positively.\nIn some cases, conditions or events such as sagging sales \nor a change in leadership create urgency for courageous \nacts\u2014and make them more likely to succeed. Tachi Yamada, \na physician-scientist turned business leader, has been a Sometimes things don\u2019t work out, even with the best \npreparation. Competently courageous people develop \nmechanisms to mitigate fallout. That might mean finding \nways to make themselves indispensable to the organization, \nkeeping external options open, or minimizing economic \nreliance on an employer. For example, former Telecom Italia \nleader Franco Bernab\u00e8 rejected many of the perks that came \nwith being the CEO of a major company, knowing that doing \nso made it easier to take risks. \u201cIf I had lost my job, \u201d he said, \n\u201cand gone back to something more subdued and less glamor -\nous\u2014well, it wouldn\u2019t have changed my life. \u201d\nChoosing Your Battles\nNot every opportunity to display courage is worth taking.

When Yamada \nbecame head of R&D at Smith Kline Beecham in 1999, he \nquickly concluded that the R&D organization needed to be \nrestructured around disease areas or \u201cassets\u201d (the molecules \nor compounds that might eventually make it to market) \nrather than the traditional silos. When a merger with another \npharmaceutical giant\u2014Glaxo\u2014was announced, he cam -\npaigned for the R&D function of the combined company to  \nbe structured in that way. The proposal didn\u2019t go over well. \nR&D leaders and scientists at Glaxo were particularly upset; \nhere was the new guy from the much smaller company in  \nthe merger telling them they needed a major change. They \n\u201cwere pretty much aligned against me, \u201d recalls Yamada.  \nBut he knew that the timing could be used to his advantage:  \n\u201cThe merger and the thin pipeline in both companies gave \nme a burning platform. \u201d His push for the reorganization \nsucceeded in part because of his ability to recognize the \nopportunity and capitalize on it.\nPersuading in the Moment\nWorkplace courage is, of course, about more than prepara -\ntion. Eventually you must take action. During this step, com -\npetently courageous people focus primarily on three things: \nframing their issue in terms that the audience will relate to, \nmaking effective use of data, and managing the emotions in \nthe room. (See \u201cFurther Reading\u201d for more on persuasion.) \nThey connect their agenda to the organization\u2019s priorities or \nvalues, or explain how it addresses critical areas of concern \nfor stakeholders. They ensure that decision makers feel \nincluded\u2014not attacked or pushed aside.\nMel Exon, a former executive at the advertising firm  \nBartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), excels at framing proposals in \nways that make them attractive to those whose support  \nshe needs. For example, when Exon and a colleague first \npitched the idea for an internal innovation unit\u2014BBH Labs\u2014\nto senior management, support was far from unanimous. \nSome executives worried that the creation of a separate inno -\nvation group would imply that parts of BBH weren\u2019t  innova -\ntive. This was a concerning in a firm that proudly considered \nitself the contrarian visionary in the industry, with a black \nsheep as its calling card.To convince the skeptics that BBH Labs was philosoph -\nically aligned with the company\u2019s mission, Exon took \nadvantage of internal stakeholders\u2019 pride in the black sheep \nimage, pointing out that some of BBH\u2019s clients had come to \nthe company specifically for groundbreaking ideas. A lab \nfocused on innovation would fulfill exactly that need. She \nwon over others by describing the work of the new lab as \nadvance scouting, promising that everyone at the firm would \nshare in its findings. Exon eventually got the go-ahead from \nsenior management, and later BBH\u2019s CEO complimented her \napproach, describing it as building on the company\u2019s DNA \nrather than trying to change it.\nKeeping your cool as you perform your courageous  \nact can be just as important as how you make your case.  \nA manager I\u2019ll call Erik, who was tasked with growing the  \nsolar business at one of the world\u2019s largest multinationals,  \nfrequently butted heads with senior executives in the com -\npany\u2019s traditional lines of business. When he sought their \nsupport for new business models, they often pushed back, \ntelling him brusquely, \u201cWe don\u2019t do that\u201d or \u201cThat will never \nwork here. \u201d The discussions could get heated, and Erik often \nfelt frustrated by the executives\u2019 defensiveness. But instead \nof taking the emotional bait, he reminded himself that their \nresponse was a normal reaction to fear of the unknown. \nAcknowledging their mindset helped him stay calm and \nconcentrate on simply making data-driven arguments.  \nIn the end, he was able to bring others around to his point \nof view, and the business made a strong pivot toward his \nrecommended strategy.\nFollowing Up\nThose who exhibit competent courage follow up after they \ntake action, no matter how things turned out. They manage \ntheir relationships with the people involved: When things  \ngo well, they thank supporters and share credit. When  \nthings go badly, they address lingering emotions and repair \nties with those who might be hurt or angry.\nFor example, Catherine Gill made an in-the-moment \ndecision to launch her campaign to change the culture at \nRoot Capital during a retreat with about 30 leaders pres  ent. \nBut as a result of her spontaneous decision, she caught the \nCEO off guard.

She assured him that she wasn\u2019t trying to start a \nrevolution; she was trying to advance the firm\u2019s evolution \ninto its ideal form.\nFollow-up also means continuing to pursue your agenda \nbeyond the first big moment of action. Even when their \ninitial steps go well, the competently courageous continue \nto advocate, reach out to secure resources, and make sure \nothers deliver on promises. And when things don\u2019t go well, \nthey take it in stride, viewing setbacks as learning opportuni -\nties rather than hiding from the fallout or giving up.\nTake Fred Keller, who established a welfare-to-career \nprogram at the company he founded, Cascade Engineering. \nIn the initiative\u2019s first incarnation, participants were often \nlate or absent, and their performance was poor. Within a few \nweeks, not one of the new hires remained, and Cascade\u2019s \nemployees and supervisors were left feeling frustrated. \nInstead of giving up, Keller viewed the failure as an oppor -\ntunity to learn. Finding that neither Cascade nor its new \nhires had been well prepared for the program, he reinstated \nit with more training for everyone involved. When this \nsecond attempt seemed headed toward a similar fate, Keller \nharnessed the growing criticism to get it right. He further \nincreased training of leaders and partnered with a county \nofficial to bring a social worker on-site to work with the new \nhires to identify and solve problems before they escalated. \nThis time Keller\u2019s persistence and learning paid off: The \nprogram is now a core part of the organization and is widely \nlauded as a model for transitioning people from welfare to \nwork. And through his persistence, Keller earned tremen -\ndous loyalty from his staff at all levels of the company.\nGetting Started\nCourage isn\u2019t required only for high-stakes campaigns. My \nresearch with Evan Bruno, a PhD student at Darden, shows \nthat a host of everyday actions require employees to act cou -\nrageously. Sometimes simply doing one\u2019s job well requires \ncourage. It\u2019s also worth noting that \u201crisk\u201d encompasses more \nthan the prospect of financial ruin or getting fired. Humans \nnaturally fear rejection, embarrassment, and all sorts of other social and economic consequences. From the outside, for \nexample, it might be easy to question whether Fred Keller\u2019s \nactions required courage. As the owner of the company, \nKeller could do whatever he wanted, so where\u2019s the risk? \nBut for years, he faced doubters both inside and outside his \norganization. To persevere knowing that people might think \nhe was a \u201cnutcase\u201d or that he was wasting time or money \ntook courage.\nThe good news is that the experiences of those I\u2019ve \nstudied show that competently courageous behaviors can \nbe learned. They\u2019re dependent on effort and practice, rather \nthan on some heroic personality trait limited to the few. (So \ndon\u2019t use that as an excuse to let yourself off the hook if you \nfind yourself in a situation that calls for courage!) One piece \nof advice I give to students and clients: Don\u2019t jump into the \ndeep end right away. Instead, approach this work incre -\nmentally by trying smaller, more manageable acts before \nproceeding to progressively harder ones. That might mean \nhaving a difficult conversation in some other sphere of life, or \nbroaching a tough topic with a colleague you like and respect, \nbefore confronting a boss about demeaning behavior. It \nmight mean guiding your own team in a new direction before \nsuggesting a transformation of the whole organization. And \nconsider what \u201csmall\u201d means to you\u2014we all have different \nperceptions of which actions require courage. (To see how \nyour perception of what takes courage lines up with others\u2019, \ntake our Workplace Courage Acts Index self-assessment at \nwww.workplacecai.com.) Then, as you tackle each step, \nfocus on what you learn, not whether it goes perfectly the \nfirst time.\nAbove all, keep your values and purpose front and center. \nYou\u2019ll have a stronger sense of self-respect through any set -\nbacks you face, and you\u2019ll be less likely to regret your actions, \nno matter how things turn out. And by using the principles \ndiscussed in this article, you\u2019ll increase the chances of suc -\ncessfully creating change, making the risks you take all the \nmore worthwhile.
